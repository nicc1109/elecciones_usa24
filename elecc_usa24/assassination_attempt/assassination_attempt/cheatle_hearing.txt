presenting an active threat so I'd like to ask you director cheeter to clarify the protoc what the protocol is for
0:05
postponing or canceling an event based on a threat and how the events on July 13th didn't meet those
0:12
standards so again I think we're talking about the distinction between suspicious behavior and a threat and at the time
0:20
that this individual was identified they were displaying suspicious to behavior I'm still waiting for interviews from
0:27
the FBI to determine what it was that identified that individual as suspicious
0:33
and what those behaviors were to to that question is suspicious Behavior does suspicious Behavior vary between
0:39
different events for instance if we have an event with a president would there not be a heightened standard for
0:44
suspicious Behavior I think that there are a number of ways that someone could be identified
0:50
as suspicious uh and it doesn't matter whether it's at a rally or an indoor
0:56
event or who the protecte is I think it's up to law enforcement or citizens to identify someone as
1:03
suspicious okay uh thank you according to the Associated Press at least six different agencies including two
1:08
Sheriff's Office local police State Police as well as fire and emergency rescue officials were involved in
1:13
securing the rally in Butler when there are so many teams uh that are collaborating who takes the lead and how
1:19
is that determined the Secret Service is responsible for the security of the site and the coordination and that was the
1:25
case on July 13th correct okay changing gears in 2024's
1:30
Appropriations budget the Secret Service was given a little over 3 billion which was about 78 million above what was
1:36
requested for 202's Budget you've requested yet another increase how much of these funds goes towards training and
1:42
improving protection procedures I would have to get back to you on the training aspect of it but
1:49
about 30% of our budget is for uh protected protection uh and facilities
1:56
and training but clearly the problem can't be a lack of funding so what exactly do you see as the core problem
2:02
that led to this fa failure that led to your agency being outgunned by a 20-year-old using his father's gun and
2:09
acting on his own without a particularly sophisticated plan or technology I think that we are waiting
2:15
to determine exactly what those failures or failure was uh so that we can make
2:21
sure that the Secret Service is stronger after this so we've heard a lot today that you
2:27
can't answer because it's an ongoing inves a that you're still figuring out the details and that you won't answer
2:33
basic questions you've said 60 days for the investigation but I simply don't think that's acceptable do you really
2:39
plan to keep avoiding questions and the American people's questions ours and the American people's questions for the next
2:45
60 days I'm not avoiding questions I want to make sure that I am providing factual
2:51
and accurate information certainly but is there no in between right between
2:57
what is obviously a fact and what you can surmise from the details that you already
3:02
have I assure you when I have a full and complete uh report of what took place on
3:08
that day I will certainly come back and make that available certainly studies indicate that the United States has
3:14
experienced an increasing levels of political violence in ttention does the Secret Service see increasing political violence as a threat to its work and if
3:21
so how is the Secret Service adapting its strategies and protocols to account for increasing political uh political
3:27
violence we are constantly Ava valuating the threats that we receive and monitoring that and we make adjustments
3:34
on a daily basis uh to our protectees based on what those threats are uh and
3:40
and what actions we need to take yes or no do you believe that stricter controls on the availability of assault weapons
3:45
would make it easier for the Secret Service to fulfill its missions of protecting public officials I think the
3:51
Secret Service is tasked with providing a safe environment which is why we put into place a number of mitigation
3:57
factors certainly but do assault weapons make it easier or harder for you to do your job I think that any weapon makes
4:03
it difficult for us to do our job okay uh i y back chair now recognizes Mr
4:09
Donalds from Florida uh thank you chairman uh director real quick at what what time
4:17
did was Secret Service aware of the active threat against President
4:25
Trump director what time so the Secret Service was aware that there was an
4:30
individual who had been identified as suspicious uh and that that individual
4:36
uh was attempting to be tracked down at what time I don't have a specific
4:41
timeline other than to tell director it's been nine days at what time I I
4:46
want to make sure that I give you factual information sir director have you talked to the agents on the ground
4:53
that day yes I have you've talked to all of them your senior team has talked to
4:58
every agent that was on the ground that day yes we have have they all corroborated the same time they
5:04
identified the shooter or they were made aware of the shooter either by attendees in the crowd or local police department
5:11
there are a number of reports of when those times were made was it five
5:16
minutes before the first shot rang out no generally speaking was it 10
5:21
minutes before the first shot rang out no it was was it 15 minutes before the first shot rang out it was less than
5:27
that time frame when the it was identified as a threat how many days
5:32
before the shooting took place did Secret Service actually do their advanced work to secure the facility that the rally was going to be held at
5:39
five days in the five days prior when the when the security uh Advance team
5:45
did their work did they that did they identify the rooftop as a Potential Threat again I'm pulling those reports
5:52
and that information it's been nine days Madam director did they know that did they notice a rooftop 150 yards away
5:58
that was a Potential Threat yes or no I am certain that the rooftop was noticed I am pulling the reports what was the
6:05
security par or the security parameters around securing that rooftop there what did they do there was
6:12
OverWatch provided for that rooftop did OverWatch fail I am waiting to hear what the
6:18
results of the investigation were so that I can identify where the failure
6:23
was who did you talk to that was on the ground that day that was responsible for
6:31
OverWatch what are their names I'm not going to provide their names in this setting did you talk to the people that
6:37
were providing OverWatch that day I've talked to the people that conducted the Advance on that day and that were
6:43
working the shift and were the counter snipers on that day so you talk to the counter sniper team you talk to the
6:49
people who were providing OverWatch that day and you talk to the advanced team correct yes sir what did they tell
6:56
you we are putting together a comprehensive report so that I can identify exactly where the gaps and the
7:03
failures when the counter sniper team was on the roof and they identified that there was a there was a susp there was
7:11
suspicious activity on the roof in question what was the chain of commands orders around the person on set
7:18
roof because I'm quite sure somebody saw in in under your organization the Secret
7:25
Service I'm quite sure somebody saw the shooter on the roof so what was the
7:31
communication through the chain of command to deal with said person what I
7:36
can tell you is that when the individual was identified by the counter sniper they took one shot and
7:44
neutralized that individual but that was after the shooter already took a shot is that
7:49
correct that is correct so what you're saying now is that the Secret Service
7:55
did not see the shooter on the roof until after the shooter took a shot I do
8:01
not have all of those details at this time if you don't have those details after 9 days director then what you're
8:06
telling me is that you guys didn't see it is that correct I am telling you I
8:11
don't have all the details of the sequence at this time director it's been nine days either you have the
8:17
information or you do not is that correct we are still in the process of
8:22
conducting interviews and an investigation some of my colleagues have texted me over the last couple days
8:28
bipartisan about whether you should lose your job and I've been quiet on that question because I wanted to see where
8:35
what you were going to do today um in my opinion you do need to be fired
8:40
immediately and it is because this is gross incompetence and the fact that it's been
8:46
nine days and these are simple questions to to answer I'm quite sure if I asked any one of my kids if they got in
8:52
trouble and I told them to give me the details I would get more answers from them than I'm getting from you right now
8:57
and that's what's frustrating on a bipar partisan basis on a nonpartisan basis this is a joke and director you're in
9:05
charge and that's why you need to go Mr chairman i y back chair now recognize Mr
9:11
Goldman from New York thank you Mr chairman um director I
9:19
I want to follow up and just understand a little bit why um there is so much information
9:26
about this out in the public including some from you and your Communications
9:33
team uh and yet you're here pursuant to a subpoena um under oath in front of
9:39
Congress and you're unable or unwilling to answer some of those same questions
9:45
can you just explain why uh you are answering so many fewer questions here
9:51
than you have to the media I'm answering the questions that I'm able to answer based on the fact
9:58
that there are multiple ongoing investigations but You' you have answered some of these
10:04
questions previously correct to the public to the media which
10:11
questions well for did you have an interview with ABC News yes I did okay
10:16
and did you explain uh the interaction between local law enforcement and the Secret Service and that local law
10:23
enforcement was responsible for securing the perimeter of the building where the
10:28
shooter was was I said that the Secret Service is responsible for Designing and
10:34
implementing and executing the security plan and that we rely on the assistance
10:39
of our local law enforcement Partners to assist us with that plan let me ask you something uh were
10:45
you given any instructions about what you can and cannot answer here
10:51
today my uh ability to answer questions is solely reflective of the fact that
10:57
there are multiple ongoing investigations and I want to make sure that I provide accurate information that
11:04
doesn't conflict with any of those investigations that are going on so is it your view that you can't talk about
11:10
anything that happened that day until those investigations are completed my view is that I want to make sure that
11:16
this committee uh and the American public gets correct and actual
11:21
information and so is it your view that that has to that can only happen after the completion of the investigation it
11:28
is my view that uh when the investigations are complete that we will be able to share that information and
11:35
how about before that if I have factual information that I can share before that I absolutely
11:41
will I'm guessing you have factual information as to when the suspicious uh
11:49
photograph the photograph of the suspicious person was relayed to the Secret Service there's a time stamp on
11:57
that text message or whatever it was was correct sir I'm sure you can understand
12:03
that uh when you're dealing with text messages emails uh and other
12:08
Communications the timelines don't always match up not not really if they're time
12:15
stamped but let me let me move on um because you have acknowledged that this was a major security failure is that
12:21
right yes do you acknowledge that it was a major security failure not to secure
12:28
the Rooftop of the building that the shooter shot from I believe at this time that the
12:35
rooftop was provided OverWatch I acknowledge that we are unaware at this
12:40
time how the individual was able to access the roof OverWatch meaning from
12:46
other counter sniper other uh higher points correct um and so was it a
12:53
failure then that when that uh shooter was on the rooftop that OverWatch did
12:59
not identify him before he fired his shots I don't have the timeline of how
13:04
the individual accessed the roof where they accessed the roof or how long they
13:11
were on the roof let me ask a Qui a couple things quickly um you have testified here about
13:19
all the resources that the Secret Service needed to deploy to protect uh the NATO Summit and all of the leaders
13:26
here is that right yes um does did you have to rely more on local
13:32
law enforcement because of the NATO Summit for this event the Secret Service routinely works
13:40
with uh local law enforcement at every event uh it doesn't matter whether it is a NATO Summit nsse the DN uh I'm sorry
13:47
the RNC in no but that's not my question obviously there's a natural give and take as to I'm sure how many agents you
13:56
deploy and how much you rely on local law en enforcement did you have to rely
14:01
more on local law enforcement because there were fewer Secret Service assets
14:07
available because of the NATO Summit no um I hope we get answers before the
14:14
completion uh I don't like the fact that the media has received far more answers
14:20
than Congress has um if this is a function of getting your ducks in a row
14:27
I I assume you have access to a lot of these reports and a lot of this information and you should have come prepared here today um and I would just
14:35
want to flag Mr chairman before you before um I yield back that I I want to
14:42
just point out one thing that that my colleague from Texas uh was talking about uh when he said he recreated this
14:49
shooting twice with an AR-15 and he had a 94% success rate 15 out of 16
14:57
shots I don't I don't know why that doesn't convince him that we should get rid of AR-15s but clearly we need to do
15:05
something about the prevalence of AR-15s and weapons of war on our streets and I yield back chair now recognize Mr Perry
15:12
from Pennsylvania thank you chairman director I guess 60 days is the time of
15:17
the investigation is that is that the information that you've put out or where did that come from 60 days or is that
15:23
just information that the committee members are talking about I stated that earlier today I've
15:29
okay 60 days so are so are you receiving regular updates you're in charge of the
15:34
Secret Service this is about your organization what happened nine days ago are you receiving regular updates from
15:40
the FBI on their investigation yes I am so you know some things are true some things are probably
15:46
not true we want to talk to you about the things that we're hearing about and find out if they're true have you you've
15:52
been in contact with the FBI then you're getting updates on a daily basis right yes Bas based on what you said Okay so
15:59
and are you confident that the person in question Mr Crooks was the only person
16:04
firing that day against the president or the crowd he is he the only one I'm not
16:09
asking you yet if he acted alone but is he the only one or can you say that with certainty to the American people that is
16:16
the information I have at this time yes okay did he does it appear he acted alone that's the information we have at
16:23
this time okay now let's talk about the fact that he was noticed as a person of
16:28
interest of concern suspicion as you say your Pi team um how do they stay in
16:36
there's a sea of people how does the pi team get to that individual that's in
16:43
question in the sea of people how they how's that individual tracked our protective intelligence
16:49
teams that work at our sites are paired up with a local police counterpart uh
16:55
and so they work in conjunction together so they just follow them around or let let me ask you this looking at the
17:01
site you have multiple perimeters right you have the secure perim the inside Perimeter you have multiple secure or multiple perimeters was the AGR
17:09
so-called building the highest location affecting the site of the rally was it the highest
17:17
location I believe the highest location at the site was where our counter snipers were what about the water tower
17:23
adjacent what about the how high is the water tower I don't have the uh height on the
17:28
water tower okay um seems like water towers are pretty high at least in the photo it looks like it might be there may be actually be a building right
17:35
behind the AGR building that is even higher than the building that Crooks fired from you're familiar with cover
17:42
concealment and defilade right you're familiar with those terms yes so how would your sniper team or your Pi team
17:51
track the individual and give vectors to Secret Service on the pi team to get to
17:57
that individual to question them and and how would you cover the defilade the cover and concealment of low areas that
18:03
you can't see from where your sniper team immediately adjacent to the president were was were cited H how
18:10
would you do that if you're not up on The High Ground so when our counter sniper teams go out and conduct in
18:16
advance they have a methodology and provide a grid system uh that our
18:21
response teams are able to uh Vector in if they see something that is troubling
18:27
so when Mr Jordan asked about the the
18:32
assets that were requested let me just ask you about assets requested were were
18:37
aerial assets requested for this event from either the Secret Service or State
18:42
Police or anybody else drone manned otherwise aerial assets were they requested I can't speak to what the
18:49
local police if they were requested have conversations with the local police but I can tell you that the assets that were
18:54
requested from the Secret Service for the site that day were all granted but
19:00
were aerial assets requ I'm just I didn't ask if you used them or what you used were they
19:06
requested OverWatch was requested and is that aerial because OverWatch could mean
19:12
on the Water Tower or not on the water tower can you be specific ma'am I'm running out of daylight here I
19:18
understand if you're asking me uh about specifics whether or not there was not clear what I'm asking you were aerial
19:25
assets requested by by the president by Secret Service service by anybody were they requested the Secret Service we
19:32
felt that we had a a good plan in place okay okay fair enough how about K9 assets with bomb sniffing or explosive
19:39
sniffing capabilities requested didn't say they were present were they requested those requests were fulfilled
19:47
they were requested and fulfilled M so was the crooks vehicle inside any of your
19:53
perimeters no it was not it was not how did you so okay so it was not within the
20:00
it was not so what was there a device located on Mr Crook's body to detonate
20:05
the vehicle that is the information that I have so what would be the point of detonating the vehicle if it was not
20:11
inside the perimeter I have no idea what Mr Crook's motivation was ma'am the fact that you
20:18
haven't not Clos with this Mr chairman haven't even visited the site I understand there are other things going on but the culture of your organization
20:26
the culture that doesn't do you know how tall the president is how tall is the
20:31
president president Trump how tall is he I don't he's over six feet tall I don't have okay so do you assign agents based
20:37
on their ability to cover physically and carry and carry if necessary the
20:43
president of the United States when you assign them to this mission is that a parameter that is
20:49
considered I assign agents to work our protectees that are capable and have
20:55
been trained by Secret Service I understand they're trained but if you're not tall enough it has nothing to do
21:00
with we're not mad at you but if somebody's 7 feet tall and you're 5et tall there's going to be a Delta there
21:07
that is problematic in protecting the protecting and I'm asking is that a consideration when you when these agents
21:13
not saying you but when they're assigned to the protecte the agents that are assigned to
21:20
our protectees are perfectly capable okay so the culture is what I'm concerned about because the primary
21:25
objective here seems to be something other than securing the site securing the the principle and securing the
21:31
people at the site and that's the concern based on the answers that you've given today so far without a yield Mr
21:37
chairman chair now recogniz to our protectees are perfectly capable so the
21:42
culture is what I'm concerned about because the primary objective here seems to be something other than securing the
21:48
site securing the the principle and securing the people at the site and that's the concern based on the answers
21:54
that you've given today so far without a yield Mr chairman chair now recognize is Mr moscowitz from Florida uh thank you
22:01
Mr chairman thank you for the this hearing uh I want to thank uh your The
22:07
subpoena that you sent I want to thank uh ranking member Rasin and your work the letter you sent to the committee and
22:12
I also support the creation of a commission to get to the bottom of what
22:18
happened director I I just want to give you an honest assessment of how this is
22:23
going for you today did you happen to catch the hearing many months ago in
22:29
education where there were a bunch of University professor of University presidents and Alise stonic asked a very
22:35
easy question and couldn't get an answer did you see that hearing no I don't think I did okay well
22:42
let me tell you it didn't go well and the short end of that story was those
22:47
University professors all resigned they're gone that's how this is going for you th this is where this is headed
22:55
okay this is I I don't know who prepared you for this I don't know how many times
23:02
you've testified in front of Congress but a president was almost assassinated
23:08
live on television not just for Americans but for the world to see and
23:13
this being your first opportunity I understand there's an ongoing investigation I understand there's things that you can not talk about but
23:21
the the idea that we're getting less than you did on television is something
23:26
that Democrats Independents or Republicans are going to find unacceptable my high school margorie
23:32
stowman Douglas was on the list of mass shootings that representative R arasin held up that very day the school
23:40
resource officer a police officer did not run into the building he hid in the stairwell while the shooter was in the
23:45
building he stayed outside never helped okay he also directed other officers who showed up on the scene not to go into
23:53
the building when it was determined that the failures in response and training
24:00
and that the sheriff fired nobody in his agency Governor D santis then removed
24:05
that sheriff I supported the removal so here's my question you said there's going to be accountability I understand you don't want to give us names when you
24:12
say that are you telling the committee that once it's concluded you're prepared to fire the people on the ground who
24:18
made poor decisions that day I'm prepared to take the actions necessary no no that's that that's nonsense okay
24:26
accountability the fail was human that doesn't mean they're bad people it means
24:31
they failed that day and a president was almost a former president was almost assassinated okay are you prepared to
24:39
fire the human failure on the ground yes or no when you have the names of where those failures were their people it's
24:46
not like a piece of technology failed it was people who failed that day are you prepared to fire
24:52
them I don't have an answer as to whether it well then how can there be accountability if you're not prepared to
24:59
fire someone and the reason why your name is going to be the person who's
25:04
held accountable the reason why members in this committee are calling for resignation and I join in that or for
25:10
the president to fire you is because you're saying there's going to be accountability but you can't commit that
25:15
people are going to get fired let me ask this question a different way if Trump
25:20
had been assassinated that day if the gunman had succeeded okay would you have
25:26
come and tendered your resignation I would still be sitting here because I
25:31
would want to ensure the Integrity of the investigation totally understand that's a fair answer that you would have
25:37
set up that process but would you have had the honor to come in front of the committee and say a president was assass
25:42
former president was assassinated on my watch there should be new leadership I think that I have admitted
25:48
that there was no no that's what I'm asking would you have tendered your resignation if he had been killed that occurred on my watch and I am
25:54
accountable for that okay but would you have tendered your resignation if he had been killed
26:01
I think that I've admitted that I've taken accountability and will take responsibility okay well let me ask a I
26:09
want to follow up on representative Connelly's question in which he asked about guns and and you were not willing
26:15
to commit that that makes your job harder this is not about the Second Amendment if there were over 400 million
26:20
guns on the streets if all of those guns were machine guns would that make your job harder to protect
26:26
people again I think weapons that are out there if all of those guns were rocket propelled grenades would that
26:33
make your job harder yes sir yes okay thank you perfect this is not a trick question
26:40
thank you okay I I won't ask the other 15 things I was going to do I was going to do drone strikes but it's okay so
26:46
that's all we were asking it it creates a challenging environment it has nothing to do with the Second Amendment or people's rights but it does make your
26:53
job harder so credit to representative Connelly for asking that question one last thing Mr chairman I'll
27:00
conclude you know there was a question asked is an Iranian assassin more capable than a 20-year-old and I have
27:05
been tough on Iran I probably have more resolutions on Iran than almost any on in Congress but I can tell you it isn't
27:11
Iranians walking into schools and grocery stores and movie theaters and churches it is 20-year-olds right and
27:18
some of them are mentally unstable and they have access to guns and they're domestic terrorists someone talked about
27:23
Christopher Ray Christopher Ray has talked about domestic terrorism and so yes we collectively come together on
27:31
foreign threats and I am not at all debasing the fact that there are foreign
27:37
threats here and abroad but there are domestic threats and we have to get to the bottom of how we stop domestic
27:44
terrorism because it was a 20-year-old who walked into my high school and killed 17 people he was plenty capable
27:51
and he was an Iranian thank you chair D recognize Mr Timmons from South Carolina thank you Mr chairman Dr Cho
27:59
we've asked you a lot of questions and haven't really got a lot of straight answers I have um intentionally created
28:04
a line of questioning that I think that you can answer so the first question is do you agree that the allocation of
28:09
secret service resources should correspond with the risk profile of Any Given
28:14
event a higher degree of risk at one event should get more resources is that fair that is fair okay and when two
28:22
events occur at the same time in the same Geographic vicinity that the risk profile of each event should should be
28:28
taken into account in whichever event is greater risk should receive greater
28:34
resources that is correct okay so I'm going to go over the Trump event so this was publicly announced July 3r Butler
28:42
Pennsylvania the venue is an outdoor Fairground open air no existing security
28:47
um the crowd size is was expected to be tens of thousands it end up being over 20,000 um there were General and
28:54
specific threats from foreign adversaries as the chairman of intelligence uh remarked Iran has said they want revenge as well as um when
29:02
President Trump was in office he um made a lot of people mad terrorists to be
29:07
included all over the world and you know president Trump is the former president and the future president so I would say
29:13
that that is a fairly highrisk event would you agree yes okay let's
29:19
conversely um the first lady had an event at a casino in Pittsburgh just do
29:27
few dozen miles away it was a dinner for the Italian Sons and Daughters of America it was publicly announced on
29:33
July 10th what's interesting is that the casino is actually extremely secure they already have magnetometers uh existing
29:40
prior to this event even being announced it was in a ballroom and the size of the crowd a mere
29:45
400 uh there were no specific threats there may have been General General threats uh and the um asset is the first
29:53
lady um those seem like there's a huge
29:58
disparity uh relative to risk would you agree yes okay thank you um multiple
30:06
whistleblowers and various media Outlets have reported that the Pittsburgh field office of the Secret Service allocated
30:12
12 additional post standers to the first ladies event and three additional post
30:17
standers to the Trump rally is that correct there were no assets that were
30:23
diverted from the first no no no no this is a very simple question I'm not asking anyone who's diverted did the first
30:29
ladies event that was relatively secure especially compared to Trump's rally get
30:34
12 assets and the first did the first ladies event get 12 assets and Trump's
30:42
get three from the Pittsburg field office it's that's a yes or no you don't
30:47
know don't answer it I mean if you don't know Personnel that were allocated to both of those events were comparable to
30:54
the risk at both of those events wow really so you think that the Pittsburgh
31:00
Casino 400 person in a ballroom with Ingress egress through probably a very well-guarded parking garage was four
31:07
times more dangerous than a 20,000 person rally on an open field with uh the former president and future
31:13
president you think that that's four times more dangerous the casino event I didn't say that at all well they got
31:19
four times of resources from the Pittsburgh field office who was likely in charge of the final walkthrough for both for both events I mean we've
31:25
continually highlighted the failures uh of the secet secret service at the Trump rally and you know you have the the
31:30
former and future president getting shot you have uh multiple uh injuries one fatality and I would have to think that
31:39
if we had nine more post standards nine more individuals that have the training
31:45
and the integration into the Secret Service uh defense of of trump at that rally that I have a feeling that Crooks
31:52
would have had somebody come say hello to him before he fired a bunch of shots what do you think that's possibly true
31:58
there were significantly more assets and resources available at the former president's event than there were at the
32:04
first who made the decision to deploy 12 uh post standers to the casino uh where
32:12
the first lady was having a 400 person dinner and only three people from the Pittsburgh field office to the 20,000
32:19
plus person plus Trump rally who made that decision there were additional secret service resources available at
32:26
the former president Trump's event who made the decision to deploy 12 to the
32:32
first ladyes event and three to the Trump event the allocation of resources
32:37
is decided based on the availability of personnel and their location and where they are but there were sufficient
32:43
resources what did you just say were given to did you just say there were sufficient resources president Trump got
32:49
shot someone got killed there were not sufficient resources clearly it does it doesn't take 27 years of experience to
32:55
know that and whoever made that decision it probably wasn't you needs to be fired and then you need to resign because this
33:01
is absolutely unacceptable you've lost the trust of the American people with that Mr chairman I yield back gentan
33:07
yields back chair I recognize M Talib from Michigan thank you so much Mr chair thank you director for being here you
33:13
know when we hear the the headline a 20 year year old young man with access to
33:19
an assault weapon commits in Mass you know Act of mass violence I mean we've
33:24
heard this before over and over again but the unfortunate thing is that my residents don't get a Committee hearing
33:32
we have not had one Committee hearing about the over 260 mass shootings that we've had killing hundreds of people
33:41
injuring hundreds changing their lives forever and don't get me wrong to many of my colleagues I mean I watched and
33:48
even the pool of blood the screams it was horrific but it made me think about
33:55
the images I saw after mass shootings at schools grocery stores I mean I think of
34:01
Buffalo New York at a supermarket where a racist gunmen killed 10 Shoppers with
34:06
an AR an El Paso AK-47 style assault rifle killed
34:14
22 in Florida and Parkland Florida 17 students and teachers murdered again
34:21
with an AR in Pittsburgh at a place of Faith
34:26
Tree of Life synagogue 11 murdered and don't get me about Newton
34:31
Connecticut which still breaks my heart 26 murdered including 20 elementary school children this year in Michigan
34:38
we've had Mr chair two mass shootings 21 shot in Detroit bigest large one of the
34:46
most horrific shootings we've seen two killed at a splash pad in Rochester
34:53
Hills Michigan eight shot there again an assault weapon used but the difference
35:00
here is the former president gets a hearing in his attempt to say but my our
35:08
residents don't get a hearing about mass shootings about gun violence in our
35:16
country you know Mr chair I I ask this wholeheartedly you know they don't have
35:23
Secret Service to protect them they don't I don't have these Mass agencies
35:29
protecting our kids in the schools or the supermarket movie theaters or going to a black party in Detroit I don't have
35:35
that we don't have that but I can't believe we're just going to focus on that and not the fact
35:41
that we're hearing yet again in the headlines a 20-year-old young man having access to an assault weapon a weapon of
35:47
War many of my veterans say they have to be trained to use but he can get it wasn't safely
35:54
stored by the parent grabbing that gun
35:59
and innocent lives or lost director I know you got asked about this and and I
36:06
think it's important though you you know for us to hear this but how how difficult is your job
36:13
when there's such easy access to assault weapons in the
36:20
streets I think the job of a secret service agent and officer is incredibly difficult I think the environment we
36:26
deal with every day and the Dynamics of the threat environment is uh incredibly
36:31
difficult these are brave men and women who put their lives on the line and a day like we had on July 13th is a day
36:39
that no one in my agency ever wants to have as their responsibility it is it is
36:45
an incredibly difficult job yeah I immediately thought of the children in the audience I mean when you think about
36:50
going to Rally with your family um again their lives are forever
36:55
changed the incident wasn't are never isolated I really believe these incidents are never isolated and I know
37:01
Detroit Free Press had reported that the 20-year-old uh Pennsylvania shooter looked up the 2021 Oxford High School
37:08
shooting in in Michigan can you comment on what information this shooter was looking up and regarding the tragedy of
37:15
Oxford High School where it took four of our high school youth there I'm sorry I'm not able to uh the FBI has those
37:22
details so you can't even tell us I mean was he looking at the type of weapon how many yeah unfortunately I don't have
37:29
those details you have I mean did they share that with you though I don't have the full content of what his searches
37:35
were I think that they are still in the process of uh examining all of his devices okay um again you know again the
37:44
impact I I I want to be really serious about this the impact on our families is more than just this political rally Mr
37:51
chair we have to talk about this even if we're in disagreement let's talk about it because I've seen statistics that
37:56
show that we could be saving lives now if we ban these weapons of war from our uh from being able to buy it at the
38:02
local store down the street I mean we just can't continue to allow this to happen and unfortunately my colleague my
38:08
my residents are not former presidents of the United States they don't get a hearing they don't get Secret Service Pro any of that and even among those
38:15
that are expressing the failed in the system they just deserve better they truly do thank you and I yield CH now
38:21
recognize Mr burett from Tennessee thank you Mr chairman uh M cheel the shooter was set up on the roof of the AGR
38:27
International building as we know was the roof identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally to
38:34
my knowledge yes it was were agents or officers inside the building if so what floor were they
38:40
on we had local police officers inside the building the roof looks like it's a 10
38:47
roof how did no one inside that building hear someone moving on top of a metal roof I don't have the details of all of
38:54
the interviews that have been conducted yet when will you have those I have been asking and I want to have
38:59
that information uh as soon as as you do as okay why did Secret Service fail to block the line of sight from that
39:06
roof I think that the Secret Service put together a plan where they were counting that roof in as part of their
39:13
OverWatch and that was the plan that they had put in place that day if you weren't going to put a security
39:18
Personnel on the roof why not at least use drone technology aerial surveillance to monitor the rally there are a number
39:25
of times that we do use uh drone Tech technology I'm not speaking specifically to this event and what was utilized or
39:31
not uh there are times when drone technology is available and helpful at events and there are times when it is
39:37
not appropriate do y'all use signal do you use personally use signal to communicate with any official from the
39:43
White House signal on your phone oh uh on
39:48
occasion uh I'm sure that there are people that use signal yes okay do you
39:54
person do you use it to speak with the White House you signal no I do not okay
40:00
when was Thomas krooks first identified as a person of interest let me help you at 510 he was
40:08
uh spotted with a rangefinder at 551 secret and and when did you when did
40:15
Secret Service notice him again I don't have those specific timelines but it was a relatively short period of time let me
40:21
help you 552 Miss cheel why was President Trump allowed on stage 10 minutes after the Secret Service spotted
40:28
a suspicious individual that seems to me to be the worst thing of all all the
40:33
breakdown and all this communication all the BS you've been feeding us here today are not feeding us that seems to be the
40:39
the the question so i' as I've stated before there are a number of events where
40:45
suspicious people may be uh identified uh that doesn't necessarily ma'am I I
40:50
submit to you you got a guy who's going to be the next president of the United States he's on stage I've been to these events we've all been to these events a
40:57
car backfires and there's a 15minute dad gam wait that's that's not acceptable
41:02
did the Secret Service tell president Trump they' they'd spotted a suspicious individual before he was
41:09
shot I am uh unclear as to what the communication was with the former president okay at that time I'll take
41:15
that as a no um did y'all deny president Trump's request for more security yes or
41:22
no and when was the when was the most recent request for additional security
41:28
the rally request uh for security uh all of those requests were fulfilled and
41:34
were there any Personnel redirected to Jill Biden's rally no who made the
41:40
decision on the direction of of of agents at either one of those
41:45
rallies I'm unclear as to your question on the direction of the agents I said who directed those agents to be at Miss
41:53
Biden's Rally or president Trump's rally the specific specific agents so there is a uh a methodology in
42:01
which agents are available for assignments uh and they are assigned based on either geographic location or
42:08
Logistics uh or flight I appreciate all that but that methodology about got president Trump killed was the security
42:14
detail guarding president Trump a temporary detail the Personnel who are assigned to the pr former president's
42:20
detail are uh assigned to him why why was there a different detail on the opening night of the convention than the
42:28
the detail that was guarding him in Pennsylvania the president has a very
42:33
large uh permanent protective detail assigned to him uh they work shift work and so it could be that people you saw
42:40
at the rally uh were not working the same shift the day that he was I can assure you ma'am somebody that's a lot
42:46
shorter than the president was not at the convention and the people that were cing down behind the the mass of of of
42:53
agents that were on top of the president were not in the convention hall at least I didn't see
42:58
them you can't answer it seem to answer a single question about an ongoing investigation ma'am and you don't know
43:05
when the information will be released publicly are you waiting for the administration to sign
43:10
off no I am waiting for the results of the investigation at which time okay let me ask you one more question you found
43:16
explosives in the shooter's possession is that correct the FBI found explosives
43:22
do we know how who directed this young man how to make those explosives I believe that the FBI is still looking
43:29
into that on their investigation miss cheel you said that the buck stops with me and I agree I don't think you should
43:35
resign I think you should have been fired ma'am you are a Dei Horror Story I've told my daughter multiple
43:42
times my wife and my daughter we talk to her all the time about how she's going to succeed in life she'll succeed in
43:49
life by achieving ma'am you have not achieved today you let the American public down if it was up to me you'd be
43:54
gone thank you Mr speak Mr chairman chair now recognize Miss Crockett from Texas thank you so much Mr chair and let
44:01
me just pick up where um my colleague from Tennessee left off uh director Cheeto was the incident on July 13th due
44:10
to Dei or rather systemic failures in communication and potentially safety
44:17
protocols the incident on the 13th has nothing to do with Dei the incident on
44:23
the 13th has to do with a failure or a gap uh either in planning or
44:29
communication thank you so much in fact um I have a few articles that I will
44:34
enter into the record uh once I wrap up that actually uh acknowledge a number of
44:41
women specifically um for their Valor in their service whether it's been in
44:46
various levels of law enforcement but you know I I want to stick here for for just a second because earlier you had a
44:52
conversation in which there was a discussion about training and and I I
44:57
want to talk about training and I want to talk about the fact that there's been
45:03
a little bit of dancing around as it relates to this being a suspicious person and this being a situation that
45:10
was perceived to be a threat and it seems as if there's a different analysis that takes place one of my questions has
45:17
to do with if you have any bias training that your officers undergo and the
45:22
reason that I asked that because as a civil rights lawyer I have learned so many times in having to deal with law
45:28
enforcement that there usually is not a perception of a threat when it is a young white male even if they are
45:36
carrying a long gun yet a lot of times at least in this country when it comes to law enforcement there is a perceived
45:43
threat just by somebody having a little bit more melanin In Their Skin So I'm curious to know because a lot of times
45:50
one of the things that we have consistently pushed for on my side of things and when I say my side is once we
45:56
are looking had a tragedy in which law enforcement made an error um is the bias
46:01
training and whether or not our officers are getting it so I'm curious to know in some of the training that you talk about that is part of your budget has bias
46:08
training been part of that yes it is okay thank you um I I know that today is
46:13
a rough day it and and on that day in Pennsylvania it was a rough day and the
46:18
reality is that I understanded and you may or may not know the answer to this question um in the space in which this
46:25
event took place it was an open carry space is that correct that is correct okay
46:31
so I H from the state of Texas and interestingly enough I was serving in
46:37
the state house right after there was a mass shooting in El Paso we had an
46:43
opportunity to do right by our citizens in Texas but we did not instead they
46:48
passed permitless carry and what my colleagues kept trying to get you to answer because we want to come up with
46:54
Solutions we don't want to keep pointing the finger and right now you've got a bunch of fingers that are pointed at you
47:00
but our job is to solve problems for the American people and to be perfectly honest the numbers are clear I had I
47:08
think almost every Major law enforcement agency come forward and say that they were against permitless carry because
47:14
they said that their jobs would be made more difficult unfortunately my colleagues on the other side of the
47:19
aisle in the state of Texas decided that they would ignore those warnings and they passed the law instead and right
47:25
after they passed that law we ended up with Uvalde and we heard the stories of those officers that were scared to go in
47:32
and save those babies because of the firearm in which that in that case
47:38
18-year-old had in his hands they also were given an opportunity to say hey raise the age and make it to where at
47:45
least you have to be 21 before you can possess this type of weapon and they chose not to and we have the facts it
47:52
shows and I'll enter this into the record as well if there is no objection deaths from Firearms keep climbing in
47:59
Texas decades after lawmakers began weakening gun regulations that is from the Texas Tribune without objection to
48:05
order thank you so much the last thing that I'm just going to make a point of saying is that we all care about this
48:12
issue because we know that there has been a spike in violence political
48:17
violence in this country are you aware of the fact that the numbers are higher right now okay in addition to that and
48:25
and I'm going to point a little blame at ourselves because right now you got all the fingers pointed at you but the
48:30
reality is that we have a number of congressional members that are consistently engaging in violent
48:36
rhetoric and it needs to be toned down the reality is that people are listening and they're paying attention but
48:41
unfortunately another thing that is happening because we're not getting answers from you today is the conspiracy theories they have already began have
48:48
you heard of any of the conspiracies yes okay the problem with these conspiracies
48:53
is that when people believe that say the president of the United States order to hit or they believe it was an inside job
48:59
or whatever conspiracies they believe because they don't have any facts in front of them that potentially incites
49:04
the next level of violence at the next event in retaliation for this so we are
49:09
only begging for your job as as it relates to being the director as well as
49:15
the men and women that you are protecting as their director that you keep them safe by making sure that the
49:21
American people have the information that they need so that they can feel as if Secret Service is on on the side of
49:27
the American people and ma'am I don't doubt the Secret Service is on the side of the American people but right now so
49:32
long as these conspiracy theories continue to Fester it is going to make your job that much harder thank you so
49:38
much and I yield chair now recognizes Miss margorie Taylor Green from Georgia Thank you Mr chairman um Miss Cheeto I'd
49:45
like to remind you that you're under oath the site team has a senior
49:50

50:25
of our personnel to today the American people are
50:30
demanding these answers from you today Miss cheel I will do the best to provide you accurate information based on the
50:37
facts that I have at this time you're not answering our questions the advance element cordinates with other Intel or
50:43
law enforcement Partners identifies threats and weaknesses at the sites and movements we'd like a copy of the
50:50
advanced report have you brought it here with you today we will comply with the request for the documentation that has
50:55
been requested when will that be Miss cheel cuz you should have brought it today I am certain that our Personnel
51:01

51:07
you're not doing well as Mr Mo moscowitz informed you you have been sitting here
51:13
for over three hours and I have you know the entire country is demanding you resign and demanding that you be fired
51:21
if you do not resign things are not going well for you you need to answer the questions was there a protective
51:27
intelligence team and what Technical Resources were utilized for that event specifically drone or helicopter
51:34
assets there were a number of technical assets that were deployed for that event
51:40
and there was a protective intelligence team that was assigned to that event why was Kooks able to fly a drone over the
51:48
entire area the day of the rally and the day of his assassination attempt to my
51:54
knowledge he did not fly the drone over the entire area how did he fly a drone over the area period any part of the
52:00
area again I would have to go back and check the timeline of when that took place and when the event why didn't you
52:06
bring the timeline with you today to answer our questions I don't have all of the answers on the timelines based on
52:13
the criminal investig were you not prepared today to answer our questions I
52:18
am prepared to answer the questions based on the information uh and wanted to be able to provide do you have a
52:23
timeline that you do you have a timeline at all from from any of the
52:28
day I have a uh timeline that does not have
52:34
specifics that's shocking I that is absolutely
52:39
unacceptable that means you are a failure at your job let's talk about things that are prohibited in Trump
52:46
rallies and I've been to a lot of trump rallies backpacks and bags
52:53
bicycles firearms uh any type of weapon or any other item
53:00
determined to be a potential safety hazard like a range a range finder would be one uh at 510 Crooks is first
53:08
observed by one of the snipers AGR sniper 1 at the building 510 510
53:13
president shot President Trump was shot in the face at 611
53:19
p.m. 528 AGR sniper 1 takes a picture of a bicycle in two bags those belong to
53:28
532 H sniper 1 spots Crooks looking at his phone and using a
53:35
rangefinder 555 Butler ESU command confirms receipt of photos and States
53:41
they have been relayed on 6:05 p.m. AGR sniper 1 later communicates that Crooks
53:47
has seen moving Northeast in direction of sheets and the crooks has a
53:53
backpack 2 minutes before the shooting while President Trump has been allowed
53:59
to take the stage people see Crooks laying on his stomach in a sniper position on the roof
54:07
and they're yelling he has a gun and they are trying to alert law enforcement
54:12
and Secret Service why was Crooks not shot by a
54:18
sniper by the snipers why was he allowed to be there as soon as the individual was
54:25
identified as a threat they were no no no no no no what do you consider to be a threat a man with a gun laying in a
54:32
sniper position a man that had a backpack a man that had a bicycle a man that had a
54:38
rangefinder at what point is he determined a threat an individual with a backpack is
54:46
not a threat an individual with a rangefinder is not a threat what about a
54:51
man laying on a building that has direct line of sight of President Trump with a
54:58
gun that people are screaming and pointing out is that a threat Miss cheel
55:04
once that individual was identified they were neutralized no they were
55:09
neutralized Cooks was neutralized after he shot President Trump in the face Miss
55:15
cheel is he only a threat once he fires the weapon as soon as the counter sniper
55:22
identified that individual they were able to neutralize them how were people in the crowd okay then let's just take
55:29
it this way people under your command did not consider him to be a threat yet people in the crowd knew he had a gun
55:35
and considered him to be a threat that means that you are a complete failure as
55:41
the Director of the Secret Service that people under your command don't perceive a man laying on a roof with direct line
55:49
to the president with a gun they don't perceive that to be a threat yet the people in the crowd do how is that
55:55
possible that's the last question but please answer the question M uh director I'm
56:01
not certain at this time how the information from the people in the crowd was relay to any law enforcement
56:07
Personnel no you knew that everyone knew the people there knew that there was a
56:13
danger they knew there was a threat to president Trump and it was allowed to happen was there a standown order Miss
56:19
cheel was there a conspiracy to kill President Trump absolutely not then how
56:24
did this happen and why are you still sitting here not turning in your letter
56:29
of resignation last question but please answer and then I'll recognize Mr Presley please answer that question that
56:34
is what we are investigating to determine we're we're waiting for your letter we are waiting for your letter of
56:40
resignation and you you really need to consider doing that before you leave today thank chair chair now recognize
56:47
Miss Presley from Massachusetts thank you no one absolutely no one should fear
56:54
for their life at a political rally in a classroom in a faith house or in their
57:01
home we must do something about political violence in all its forms and
57:06
gun violence in all of its forms now director cheel you have noted
57:12
that numerous investigations are ongoing related to the Secret Service response and that we can expect a report in the
57:17
next 60 days with the election nearly 100 days away that is an unacceptable
57:22
timeline and it makes people less safe it also allows my colleagues across the
57:30
aisle Republicans additional time to spread dangerous
57:35
misinformation which also puts People In Harm's Way some Republicans have exploited this moment to continue to
57:42
attack progress towards racial Justice and gender equity in America disappointing but not
57:48
surprising I hesitate to repeat their racist and sexist tropes but in summary
57:53
Republicans have wrongfully and shamefully stated that hiring women and people of color
58:00
hindered the response to the shooting now this is part and parsal of Republican strategy to constantly attack
58:08
necessary diversity equity and inclusion efforts to undermine the contributions
58:13
that women people of color the disability community and others make to this country each and every day and it
58:21
is disgraceful in the wake of gun violence and tragic loss of life Republic an are ignoring Solutions like
58:28
gun safety reform and instead trotting out sexist tropes can't say I'm
58:34
surprised I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record reporting from CNN titled right-wing media figures blame
58:42
women in secret service and Dei for security failure in Trump
58:49
shooting without that objection to ordered this article quotes members of Congress and others that plainly accuse
58:55
Dei and the hiring of women as a liability for the Secret Service women
59:00
have been an integral part of the agency since 1971 and are held to the same standards
59:06
as their male counterparts to use them as a scapegoat during a time of Crisis
59:11
is shameful and it is dangerously divisive in fact based on recent publicly available
59:19
demographic data of the agency the largest demographic groups among special
59:25
agents are white and male but to right-wing extremists the
59:31
truth doesn't matter the lies they tell to advance their anti-diversity agenda
59:37
which is a key theme throughout project 2025 will only make the American public
59:42
less safe and more divided and every day director Cheeto that you fail to give us
59:49
answers they are given more oxygen to make their baseless claims that women
59:56
and people of color are responsible for tragic events and that is dangerous too
1:00:02
thank you and I yield my remaining time to ranking member Rasin uh thank you to the distinguished
1:00:09
gentle lady from Massachusetts and thank you for those trenchant insights um I
1:00:15
wanted to make the the point that that you were making and several of other
1:00:20
members were making to bring it into sharp relief here um the very same day
1:00:28
that uh Donald Trump narrowly escaped an assassination
1:00:33
attempt um but an honored firefighter was gunned down and killed and other
1:00:40
people were injured there was another mass shooting that day uh just several hours later in Birmingham Alabama four
1:00:47
people killed and 10 wounded in a nightclub shooting and you might think oh that's some kind of freakish
1:00:54
coincidence not at all we have more than one mass shooting a day in America they
1:01:00
are so commonplace now that they are barely reported in the national news it's of course local news in Birmingham
1:01:06
Alabama that four people were killed and 10 other people were shot and seriously wounded being treated at the
1:01:13
hospital uh these things are a nightmare for the families of the victims who've
1:01:20
been killed for the families who have to take care of people who've been seriously injured and wounded they are a
1:01:26
major Financial drain publicly and privately and yet we allow um AR-15s to
1:01:35
be purchased with abandon promiscuously all over the country people can just go
1:01:41
out and get an assault weapon and the distinguished General lady from Michigan was right we have a hearing when it
1:01:48
affects the president of the United States but on all the other days of the year we don't have a hearing about it
1:01:54
and I think it is because of an honest disagreement we have about the Second Amendment there are some people who
1:02:00
think the Second Amendment means you've got the right to arm yourself with whatever Weaponry you need to overthrow
1:02:07
the government of the United States and we reject that as a false interpretation of the Second Amendment and a false
1:02:13
interpretation of the Constitution we can ban assault weapons we did it back in 1994 it dramatically reduced these
1:02:21
mass shootings and when that ban was lifted the mass shootings went up through the roof
1:02:26
again and we've shown it and so just like we're demanding real answers and real action from the Secret Service let
1:02:33
us demand real action and real answers from ourselves about the nightmare of
1:02:41
Mass Gun Violence which puts America into a category all its own when you compare us to the countries in the
1:02:47
European Union or Canada or other similarly situated countries there's nothing like what we're going through so
1:02:54
we've got to act on the secrets service to protect ourselves against political violence and we got to act as a Congress
1:03:00
to protect ourselves against AR-15 violence in America chair recognizes Miss mlan from
1:03:07
Michigan thank you uh Mr chairman and first of all I want to thank the Secret Service agents those who work tirelessly
1:03:14
to protect our presidents and specifically those agents who did not hesitate to jump in front of President
1:03:21
Trump and my heart goes out to the family um of the compor family and the
1:03:27
people at the rally who are still recovering um on the other hand the
1:03:32
secret service has a leadership problem and and it falls on you and although I
1:03:38
appreciate your Hollow words that the buck stops here I was actually hoping
1:03:44
for some answers director cheel you must answer to the American people if you
1:03:52
want to stay in charge it's it's really really really simple you want to keep your job right absolutely okay the best
1:04:00
way to keep your job is to answer the questions not play this shell game not
1:04:07

1:04:13
for this hearing I've been preparing for this hearing over the weekend and into last

1:05:03
remember you got little Alzheimer's dementia going I mean what you can't remember I have several active
1:05:09
investigations going on in an operational agency to run okay all right but you want to take accountability
1:05:16
right the buck stops with you right I am taking accountability super then let's start with trying to answer some
1:05:23
questions you keep referring to the FBI when asked how many shell casings were
1:05:29
on the roof you referred to the FBI when asked if there were explosive in the car
1:05:34
you referred to the FBI when asked if Crooks was acting alone you referred to the FBI see a common theme here I can go
1:05:41
on and on my question is who at the FBI should I speak
1:05:47
with wait for it wait for it the FBI is responsible for the criminal is there a
1:05:53
name I'm not certain I'm not certain all
1:05:58
right here we go I'm not certain I don't know let me ask a different question have you been in communication with the
1:06:05
FBI yes I have with whom I speak with the director and the deputy director
1:06:10
okay and what have they shared with you about this investigation so I'll give
1:06:16
you an a an an opportunity to answer again did they share with you how many
1:06:22
shell casings were on the roof they shared with me the evidence did they share with you how many shell
1:06:30
casing were on the roof yes okay how many were
1:06:36
there I would refer to the FBI for their investigation many were there and their information that they need to share in
1:06:42
their investigation so they've shared the information with you you just W don't want to share the information with
1:06:49
us correct we have concurrent investigations that are going on so they have shared this information with you
1:06:56
you know the answer to the question you just refer refuse to answer the question
1:07:03
from the member of Congress who has subpoenaed you to be here is there a different answer to that question I was
1:07:11
always willing to come here and testify before this oversight hearing beautiful then let's do that let's let's for once
1:07:18
have your actions match your words so you've been in the in in communication
1:07:23
with the FBI you know know the answers and you refuse to tell us the answers so
1:07:29
I will ask you again you know how many shell casings were on that roof what is the answer to that question I think it's
1:07:37
pertinent what is the answer to that question I think it's pertinent to talk
1:07:43
to you about the information that the secret service has and that the Secret Service knows related I'm asking you an
1:07:49
answer to the question if you're supposed to be in charge if the buck
1:07:54
stops with you how come you can't share the answers what are you covering up what are you
1:08:00
hiding my friend I'm not covering anything up then why can't you answer a simple question I
1:08:07
would leave it to the criminal investigation to answer questions related to
1:08:12
that when when you talk to the FBI and you asked them how many explosiv
1:08:20
well let me ask you did you ask them how many explosives were on the roof did they answer that question or in the car
1:08:26
excuse me did they answer that question for you yes yes so you know the answer to
1:08:32
that question that my colleagues have asked you but again you refuse to give us the answers your planing this wasn't
1:08:38
me well I submit to you if you can't and it's not a can't
1:08:45
it's a won't it's not a can't it's not a I don't know it's a I choose not to

1:08:58
charge then answer the question or step aside and have someone with the courage
1:09:04
and the guts to answer to the American people the questions that they deserve answers to and with that I yield back
1:09:11
chair now recognize Miss bobbert from Colorado thank you Mr chairman I'm going to continue down that vein um you have
1:09:17
been here sitting today director cheel uh definitively able to dismiss erroneous uh information and speculation
1:09:25
how ever you are refusing to answer questions that we now know that you have the information for you are are saying
1:09:33
that you are wanting to answer questions that the uh secret service has information to Well ma'am you are the
1:09:38
Secret Service you are the director you have said that you are the best for the job so I'm going to ask you some
1:09:45
questions now now knowing that you do have answers from the FBI whom you have
1:09:51
been passing the buck to this entire day and um I'll start with something that
1:09:57
you know maybe the FBI doesn't know because it's has to do with you personally you said you spoke with
1:10:02
President Trump after the assassination attempt and I want to know did you apologize to him directly for nearly
1:10:10
having president Trump killed yes I did I appreciate that I
1:10:16
appreciate that you recognize that this was your failure now since the
1:10:21
assassination attempt you are under oath remind reming You Have you communicated
1:10:28
with anyone at the White House on an encrypted messaging app like
1:10:35
signal yes or no no no I have not are you willing to surrender your personal
1:10:40
phone for analysis uh if I am required to do
1:10:46
so okay um I will look into making that request because I would like to see your
1:10:51
personal phone to see if you're communicating over encrypted uh messaging app have you um ever turned
1:10:56
down enhanced security requests from Donald Trump's detail um his special
1:11:02
agent in charge Sean Karan you ever turned that down no I have not have
1:11:08
there been re as has your team has a secret service
1:11:13
maybe not you personally I believe as I mentioned earlier there are times when requests
1:11:19
are made for you have denied them they have been denied and a denial doesn't has the Trump campaign made re EST for
1:11:25
additional assets that have been denied denial doesn't mean vulnerability have there been additional
1:11:32
requests for enhanced security at Mar Lago uh we have made a number of
1:11:37
enhancements to you confirmed that there were bomb sniffing dogs that were provided you failed to confirm if there
1:11:44
were aerial security surveillance uh assets that were provided so yes or no
1:11:50
was that provided at the rally at the rally yes ma'am we had OverWatch provided at the
1:11:57
rally you've confirmed that the Assassin was identified as suspicious 57 minutes
1:12:02
prior to the shooting was the suspicious individual ever approached by an
1:12:10
agent was any contact ever made with him uh not to my knowledge is that the
1:12:15
standard protocol for someone who is identified as suspicious the protocol would be to
1:12:23
locate the individual and and you said that he was located two to five times approximately no I said that the
1:12:29
information was passed potentially somewhere between two to he was never located by an agent to my knowledge that
1:12:36
individual was not located by an agent we have we have dozens of rally goers who have identified him and not one
1:12:43
agent on the ground there are many many many agents on the ground local law enforcement Secret Service no one was
1:12:48
able to identify him and have sites on and and see him what I'm saying is that the agents
1:12:55
that were on the ground at the time uh I have no knowledge that they were able to uh interview him or locate him thank you
1:13:03
was was there um a local law enforcement officer who approached the roof and saw
1:13:08
the shooter uh and and saw that he was present on the roof that is the
1:13:13
information that has been shared with me have you spoke to that local law enforcement officer no I have not are you going to it is part of a criminal
1:13:21
investigation that the FBI is interviewing those individuals
1:13:27
were agents stationed on the water tower no
1:13:32
why that would not be something uh that would be included in a security plan has a man who is reported to have
1:13:41
been present um wearing a gray suit who allegedly requested a photo of the dead body of the assassin on top of the AGR
1:13:49
roof been identified I don't have that information is that something that you've heard
1:13:56
of no were ATF agents present at the
1:14:01
rally to attend or to work to work not to my knowledge how long did the counter
1:14:08
sniper have Crooks in his in his sights before the shooter open fire on
1:14:13
President Trump I don't have that specific timeline will you be able to tell us if he communicated with other
1:14:20
agents on what he was seeing through his sites once I have that information
1:14:26
absolutely because we need to know why he waited for multiple rounds to be fired at president Trump before the
1:14:33
threat was neutralized we need to know if he was given an order to hold fire
1:14:39
now it's um you've excused the roof of being um unmanned because of the slope
1:14:45
of the roof do you continue to assert the slope of the roof as a credible
1:14:50
reason for leaving this position undefended first I'll go back and correct that
1:14:57
there was no order to hold fire our agents and officers uh have the ability
1:15:03
to neutralize a threat at the time see it you I'm sorry you don't know the communication that was taking place or
1:15:09
how long he had admitt his sites because you haven't spoke to him but you do know that there was no order to hold fire I
1:15:15
can tell you the way that our Personnel are trained they are trained on the use of force scale that when they see a
1:15:20
threat they are authorized to neutralize that threat there is know they don't have to ask for permission you excuse
1:15:28
the roof being unmanned because of the slope do you stand by that assertion the roof was not covered with
1:15:36
an individual on it because there was OverWatch provided apparently not no there was no
1:15:42
OverWatch provided this is is very evident president Trump was shot a man
1:15:48
died there was no oversight provided I I I find this rather maddening especially
1:15:53
now knowing that you do have answers from the FBI who you have been passing the buck to this entire hearing not
1:16:01
answering a congressional hearing members of Congress while you were under oath and under a subpoena I I find it
1:16:08
maddening that the director um that our country has come centimeters away from
1:16:14
Oblivion under your watch you have answers you are refusing to give those
1:16:20
to us uh directing us to the FBI and this entire thing is a waste of time you
1:16:29
you are responsible for the loss of a life and the shooting that took place on
1:16:35
President Trump you do need to resign this is bipartisan you need to be fired
1:16:40
you do not need to hold this position you are not the best for this job I am over my time but I I cannot tolerate
1:16:46
your watch any longer and I'm going to continue to call daily for you to be removed from your position ma'am chair
1:16:53
recognize Mr Fry from South in thank you Mr chairman director cheel how long have
1:16:59
you been with the secret service 29 years right that's correct and how long have you been director of The Secret
1:17:05
Service just under two years during your tenure as director under the Secret Service I know we're here today to talk
1:17:11
about the assassination attemp attempt on President Trump but how many other security lapses have occurred with
1:17:18
protectees under your watch I don't have a specific number but
1:17:24
there have been uh some lapses there have been other lapses was one of them Jake
1:17:30
Sullivan yes sir what happened there there was an individual who was
1:17:35
able to access uh Mr Sullivan's residence his residence a protecte
1:17:41
somebody was able to break into his house and what happened did anyone get fired because of
1:17:46
that there were individuals who have been reassigned reassigned what other
1:17:52
what other steps have taken what I'm seeing what what other excuse me what other uh incidents have occurred other
1:17:57
than Jake Sullivan was there an issue with the
1:18:03
secret service agent and vice president Harris I would not call that a security
1:18:12
incident well it seems to me I mean you have security lapses with President Trump you have security lapses with Jake
1:18:18
Sullivan you have issues uh with your personnel related to vice president kamla Harris there seems to be a
1:18:24
repeated theme here would you not agree with that I think that we are talking about separate categories of incidents
1:18:31
well I I would disagree with that I think there's a repeated theme when you've got protectees and you're not you're not upholding your core Mission
1:18:37
let me ask you something else uh does the Secret Service routinely record Communications between and amongst
1:18:46
detail radio communications any communication email Communications are
1:18:54
uh captured as well as text messages and then depending on the detail radio
1:19:01
communications are recorded does the Secret Service have recorded Communications from the July 13th event
1:19:06
we do not have radio communications from that day but you have text messages we do have uh emails and text messages
1:19:13
emails okay great does the head of the uh Trump detail or someone else embedded in this detail have command
1:19:19
decision-making Authority or do they need to seek authorization from someone outside that detail
1:19:25
the head of the detail has uh the decision-making Authority for things that are necessary for that detail is
1:19:31
that standard for protection details yes it is okay let me ask you something
1:19:38
um during campaign events is it common for the Secret Service to utilize other agencies yes it is what uh other
1:19:45
agencies would be providing assistance to the Secret Service uh there are a number of other agencies that uh provide
1:19:52
assistance to the Secret Service during campaign means uh we uh utilize Personnel from the Department of
1:19:58
Homeland Security we utilize Personnel from the Department of Defense uh and we utilize local law enforcement partners
1:20:06
are you are you on the same radios do you provide the radios to to all the assets that are taking part in
1:20:12
protection of an event uh we provide radios to the Personnel from the Department of Homeland Security that are
1:20:18
assisting us but not local law enforcement local law enforcement is working on their own radios are you on
1:20:24
the same free quency we uh ensure that we have uh counterparts in the security room and so
1:20:31
the local law enforcement will place uh one of their personnel uh in the security room with our Personnel so that
1:20:38
we have interoperate interoperability Communications let me ask you something just about the timeline because I think
1:20:44
this is really interesting that we can't nail that down I mean I think there are lay people out there with more knowledge
1:20:50
about the timeline than you seem to come before a subpoena in front of Congress was Mr Crooks observed at the AGR
1:20:56
building prior to the shooting he was observed on the grounds
1:21:02
uh outside of our perimeter prior to the shooting at approximately what time was that you don't have to give me the
1:21:07
specific minute but at approximately what time was that I believe it was about 45 minutes or so prior to did did
1:21:14
the sniper the sniper team take a photo of Mr Crooks the the local team did yes so it
1:21:21
was a local team and not a secret service sniper that took the photo okay and did he relay that photo to
1:21:28
Central Command uh again it's an act of ongoing investigation so we I want to make sure
1:21:35
that I'm factual with the route that that photo took and who that was
1:21:41
disseminated to and when what time did the um did did the did Mr what when did
1:21:46
Mr krook's status go from a suspicion a person that was uh Under Suspicion to a
1:21:52
threat when did that happen for and maybe not even a specific time
1:21:58
director Cheeto maybe a certain event that happened that transformed him from a su a person of Suspicion to a threat
1:22:05
when did that happen to the best of my knowledge based
1:22:11
on what I have been told thus far it's approximately five minutes to where uh
1:22:16
individuals relayed that there was an incident being or an issue I'm sorry
1:22:23
being worked at the 3:00 of the president so that was but it was before
1:22:29
the shots were fired that is correct but again it was not uh phrased as a threat
1:22:35
it was just that something was being worked yeah but my question is when did he become sus when when did he
1:22:40
transformed from suspicion to threat because they're treated very differently people can be suspicious but they're not
1:22:46
a threat until a certain point in time so when did that happen I believe that it was seconds uh before the guns the
1:22:54
gunfire started seconds my gosh we actually have a few questions that we got answered today listen I'm going to
1:22:59
wrap up here uh Mr chairman but here is the frustration that people have the buck stops with you you've said that
1:23:06
yourself but the problem in Washington DC it is the only town in America that
1:23:11
you can be so bad at your job that you actually get a promotion or don't get fired you have not been able to answer
1:23:17
the number of Agents uh whether or not requests were denied on additional security whether or not law enforcements
1:23:22
were able to engage for the shooting with the Assassin how he got on the roof how the rifle got on the roof you can't
1:23:29
tell us how many shots he fired whether the casings were recovered you can't tell us anything about his cell phone
1:23:34
you can't tell us uh whether the rally was supposed to be postponed given the intelligence that was you were receiving
1:23:39
you can't tell us whether the car had a bomb you can't even tell us his motive and the American people are incredibly
1:23:46
distrustful because it has taken nine days to even get a cintilla of evidence out of you maybe if I was CNN or ABC or
1:23:53
NBC I would have gotten much more thorough and accurate information but we have not received that in a subpoena
1:24:00
Hearing in front of this Congress that is why the American people are frustrated and I Echo the bipartisan
1:24:05
calls on this committee and all across this country that you should resign or maybe when the president wakes up from
1:24:11
his nap he can fire you thank you Mr chairman chair now recognizes Miss Luna from Florida director sheel can you
1:24:17
please give me the names of the individuals who are in charge of your conop for the
1:24:22
rally I'm not going to release names can you give me the titles and how many
1:24:28
individuals no we had a full Advance Team that was responsible for Advan how many people are the final approval
1:24:34
Authority there are a number of people that are engaged in approving plan a
1:24:40
number no I do not have a firm number can you just confirm whether or not I understand this is an open investigation
1:24:46
but but in order in order to dispel conspiracy theorist have you guys been able to subpoena the shooters Discord
1:24:52
records or has the FBI to your knowledge I believe that the FBI is working on
1:24:57
those okay is it factual to say that you have not ruled out that the shooter was working with other people or persons
1:25:04
again the FBI is conducting the criminal investigation into can you at least in an effort to dispel conspiracy theories
1:25:10
can you confirm or deny that at this time we do not have that there were any other people engaged so you believe he's
1:25:15
acting alone I do okay have you been made aware of multiple eyewitness reporting that there was a sh a second
1:25:22
shooter on a water tower I do not have any information related to any second shooter okay uh the reason I
1:25:29
asked that is because according to testimony from multiple Witnesses they did report that and again I to my
1:25:35
understanding there were over 40 sniper teams that were briefed by the butler ESU and I want to make sure that people
1:25:41
are aware if you're saying that there's not another shooter that we are able to clear that information because from this
1:25:47
whole entire briefing it doesn't seem like much information has been able to get out to the American people so I'm trying to dispel rumors as I'm sure you
1:25:54
stand um was it true that secret service was present at the butler ESU
1:26:00
briefing there was a briefing between the uh counter sniper teams that were
1:26:07
working on the yes to my knowledge okay I want to read you report from people that seem to
1:26:13
be throwing you under the bus and stated that they were in attendance and that secret service was not in attendance at
1:26:18
the security briefing according to individuals with knowledge to also include that the AGR B building where
1:26:24
the shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks was located um was actually not a part of
1:26:30
their security perimeter for that so there was not Secret Service
1:26:35
present um it seems as though that when you were asked earlier from rep Christa
1:26:40
morthy about whether or not Secret Service was aware of a threat you had said no they were unaware of a threat
1:26:47
and yet according to Communications again from La law enforcement that were in some of these group chats they
1:26:53
actually had reported that secret service was made aware of a threat at around 5:59 p.m. as a part of the
1:27:00
command including Secret Service aware of messages and requests about in uh information about the suspect's location
1:27:08
can you please tell me if you have knowledge of that at all again I think we're conflating the T the difference
1:27:14
between the term threat and suspicious but you guys did have knowledge at 5:59
1:27:20
p.m. according to those group chats did you not of a suspicious individual okay um chairman in my opinion According
1:27:28
to some of the testimony today I feel that you have perjured yourself in some instances and so I'm going to ask for a
1:27:33
full review of the transcripts by staff and if you find that to be the case I do ask that you bring perjury charges against the director um I will say this
1:27:41
it is very frustrating and I've talked to my colleagues and we've said it to your face that you have been up here
1:27:47
basically stonewalling our ability to get the answers to the American people and what I will also say is that every
1:27:53
single member of Congress does not feel safe with you in charge you have heard that and I think that we are all sitting ducks with you and directing the Secret
1:28:00
Service currently uh but more importantly it sends a message to our adversaries that we are not protected
1:28:05
and we are one of the strongest countries in the world so you have essentially made us a less safe country because of it um as a result of that I'm
1:28:12
asking you to formally step down I share my same opinions as my Democrat colleagues and I also think that your
1:28:20
efforts to bring forward a full um investigation and Report in 60 days is
1:28:25
unacceptable and as a result of that I'm going to do everything in my legislative toolkit to ensure that that happen
1:28:30
sooner rather than later and I'm sure that you know that we brought a vote on inherent contempt against Garland for
1:28:36
essentially blocking a congressional investigation and I don't think that you should be any different so um I will say
1:28:42
that I am just completely disgusted by your performance today and I understand that you are probably in a position
1:28:48
where you're being told not to testify which is why we had to subpoena you I think that goes back to Garland but again that is part of the
1:28:54
uh flushing that we need to get out of Washington and I would be happy to assist in that process chairman I yeld the rest of my time chair now recognizes
1:29:02
Mr Langworthy from New York thank you very much Mr chairman and I appreciate you bringing this U hearing forward with
1:29:09
subpoena uh director yesterday I made the decision to get my car and drive to
1:29:14
Butler Pennsylvania in preparation for this moment and in asking you questions about uh uh the events of of the
1:29:22
assassination attempt on president Trump's life uh i' I've done several presidential Advance uh events in Prior
1:29:29
in my career and I I wanted to see this site with my own two eyes because I don't believe the video footage tells
1:29:34
the whole story or looking at things on a diagram and I was absolutely appalled
1:29:40
when I went to the site when I saw the fact that I could have stood on the roof of that building the AGR building and
1:29:48
hit that Podium with a nineiron and I'm a lousy golfer and the fact that that was not included in the perimeter
1:29:54
is a complete dereliction of the duty of the US Secret Service I mean there are very few rooftops that needed to be
1:30:00
secured and the fact that secret service as they were putting a site plan in place did not think it was necessary to
1:30:08
man those rooftops you have completely walked away from your duties you had one job and
1:30:14
that's to protect the future president of the United States or to protect all of the other
1:30:21
protectees and president Trump is only here today by God's grace because he had
1:30:26
just something in him that made him turn his head just slightly or we would be in a national period of morning right now
1:30:33
and you have done nothing here today I've Rewritten these questions like four times during your hearing and you
1:30:39
haven't answered a damn one of them you haven't given any information you have hidden behind this FBI investigation and
1:30:44
I think you should be ashamed of yourself because you have brought more shame to your agency than I think that
1:30:49
the assassination attempt has at this point this is literally the worst performance I have ever seen in front of
1:30:55
a congressional hearing I you have offered no reason for this committee
1:31:00
this body or the American people to trust you or the secret service today and you should resign uh you have said
1:31:07
that you've put new security measures in place after the assassination attempt can you tell us what those
1:31:12
are because the American people want to know that you're taking real corrective measures but today you've pointed to an
1:31:19
investigation investigation or not you still have a job to do with a zero fail Mission but so far there's been
1:31:25
absolutely no accountability and you've admitted that here today not one person's been suspended not one person's
1:31:31
been put on a desk meanwhile we've got the most contentious of elections in our
1:31:37
nation's history in protectees are in danger because of incompetent leadership
1:31:42
not not the agents the agents piled on President Trump to protect his life
1:31:48
those are heroes but the administrators running your agency they're not right now they're not doing their jobs and you
1:31:55
certainly aren't doing the most appalling part of Saturday's events is the countless opportunities that secret service had to stop Crooks before he
1:32:02
even got on the roof at 3:00 Crooks raised suspicion by entering the rally with a rangefinder at 5:45 a cop with a
1:32:09
Beaver County Emergency Services Unit saw Crooks eyeballing the roof at the AGR International building and then at
1:32:16
555 Secret Service was warned of a suspicious person and identifies Crooks as a threat this was all before shots
1:32:23
were fired 15 minutes later director yes or no did local law enforcement alert
1:32:28
the Secret Service about Crook's Presence at the rally yes they
1:32:33
did the shooter came to attention of law enforcement almost an hour before President Trump went on stage law
1:32:39
enforcement alerted the Secret Service of the shooter over and over you said there's a difference between a suspicious individual and a threatening
1:32:46
individual can you explain what the shooter needed to exemplify to be called a threat
1:32:54
so I'm not clear as to what identified him as suspicious to the individuals who
1:33:00
uh originally clarified him that way for the Secret Service for an individual to
1:33:05
be determined to be a threat that individual would have to be seen uh with a weapon or capable of doing some sort
1:33:13
of harm to our protectees I I I mean director an individual walking into a rally with a rangefinder scoping out an
1:33:20
unprotected rooftop and he reportedly flew a drone over hours before it sounds like a lot more than suspicious
1:33:26
especially at a presidential rally uh your operational lapses your resource management and poor judgment nearly
1:33:32
resulted in the assassination of President Trump I mean the D elction of Duty here is is just appalling the fact
1:33:39
that you haven't visited Butler I is just maddening to me that you're not
1:33:45
taking this job seriously I you know many people here have called for your resignation I've introduced a resolution
1:33:51
here into this body that hopefully will get a vote this week calling on the president to fire you ma'am you have not
1:33:58
done your job you have put a two black eyes on your agency and you need to go
1:34:04
Mr chairman I yield back gentleman yields back chair now recognizes Mr Burleson from
1:34:10
Missouri director cheel um I just want to kind of get an idea of what you can
1:34:17
answer um because outside of what the FBI was responsible for you have have
1:34:23
full responsibility for the Department of of secret service so the question is
1:34:29
what is the mission what is your what's the who and who defines the mission our mission of the Secret
1:34:35
Service is to protect uh the president the vice president uh their immediate families uh presidential candidates the
1:34:43
former presidents and uh those by executive order and we also have an investigative Mission and and those are
1:34:49
well defined yes they everyone within the agency understands the mission yes they do what about protocols and
1:34:55
standards who defines the protocols and standards we have a number of protocols and policies in place for uh the various
1:35:03
uh missions that we have so would would it be safe to say that you failed the
1:35:08
mission the ultimate Mission I have stated repeatedly here today that there was a failure what about specific
1:35:15
failures within protocols and and guidelines within the
1:35:21
agency again I am uh certain that the investigation that is being conducted
1:35:27
internally as well as the external investigation you said you said earlier in the hearing that there was either a communication there was there was a
1:35:34
there's errors in communication or in operations could it be
1:35:39
both in in both errors in operational decisions and errors in
1:35:45
Communications I think the investigation potentially could uh identify both so I
1:35:52
want to talk about communication um representative bobbert asked earlier about using encrypted apps that you said
1:35:58
you've not used I guess signal um are you have you used any encrypted app to
1:36:06
communicate on from your personal device I do on occasion uh use encrypted
1:36:13
apps to communicate uh so you use some form of an encrypted app to
1:36:20
communicate with with people within the Federal government with local law
1:36:25
enforcement whom whom are you communicating using encrypted apps uh many times it's with colleagues and uh
1:36:33
and Associates so you're communicating with colleagues on a personal
1:36:38
device there are times that the Secret Service when we work uh internationally
1:36:44
uh with some of our partners that they don't have the same texting capability and you you're not able to do
1:36:50
that with your with your government issued device uh recently we have been able to uh
1:36:57
install some of those apps on government devices okay um let's talk about some of
1:37:03
the things uh that we can get access to I'm actually shocked that you are using
1:37:09
your personal device um encrypted communication tools I think that that might be the most shocking thing that
1:37:15
I've heard today I didn't expect to you for you to say that
1:37:20
um the we have requested this committee has requested multiple documents and
1:37:26
this is not you know in under the purview of the FBI this is under your purview we requested a complete list of
1:37:32
all law enforcement Personnel including Secret Service Department of Homeland Security local law enforcement with the
1:37:38
roles in protecting the president and we requested that to be for us to receive
1:37:43
that by July 18th did we did you provide that I believe that our agency is in the
1:37:49
process of collecting all documents so you did not you have not provide provided it how long does it take to
1:37:54
determine who the the Personnel were that were on site we are collecting a
1:37:59
comprehensive list of all the documents that have been requested we also requested all the audio and video
1:38:05
recordings that your agency not the FBI but your agency has in possession
1:38:11
related to the event did we receive those have you provided those at all we are in the process of collecting all
1:38:16
documentation requested you're in the process but you have not um any memorandum
1:38:24
or any internal Communications related to the to the event you we requested that you provide
1:38:31
that have you provided any of that we are in the process of collecting the information that has been requested okay
1:38:39
so when can we expect to receive these documents how long does it take to to to
1:38:45
determine who was on site who was who was being employed to be there to protect the pre the former president uh
1:38:53
when can we expect that how long how many days does it take to provide that information we want to make sure that we
1:38:58
have a comprehensive uh accounting of all of the documents uh that were engaged in that day and we will make
1:39:05
them available as soon as possible I think transparency is the key here it's shocking to me that we are communicating
1:39:11
in in a um encrypted app to colleagues um I I'm almost certain that violates
1:39:18
some federal laws I I would like to clarify you didn't ask me whether my communications were
1:39:24
uh government work related or whether they were personally related you're communicating with colle communicate uh
1:39:29
government business with colleagues on a personal device I communicate on my work
1:39:35
device are you using an encrypted device on your work device I am not no no encrypted apps no I do not okay thank
1:39:42
you Mr chairman chair now recognize Mr Waltz from Florida uh Madam director please I'd
1:39:50
like to direct your attention to this video and and I sincerely appreciate the clarity on this turn up the volume St I
1:39:57
just want to ask you because this has been this has popped up Republican Congressman Mike walls he said on social
1:40:02
media on Saturday and I'm going to read this for you because it does talk about you secretary I have very reliable
1:40:08
sources telling me that there have been repeated requests for stronger Secret Service protection for president Trump
1:40:13
denied by secretary mayorcas your department has already pushed back on that calling that absolutely false but
1:40:21
he is putting this on you can you respond to that please well that is yeah that's a that's
1:40:28
a a baseless and irresponsible statement and is one that is unequivocally
1:40:35
false director Cheeto did you speak with your boss uh secretary my
1:40:44
orcus you you fall under DHS did you speak with him on the 14th the day after
1:40:50
yes I did so you spoke with him before he made that statement I spoke with him uh the immediately follow did incident
1:40:58
did you inform him that all requests for additional
1:41:03
resources for president Trump had been fulfilled I or or that it was false to
1:41:08
say they had been denied I informed him that the request uh for that rally that
1:41:15
day had been fulfilled okay you're you continue to
1:41:20
answer that very carefully because I made a broader statement the agents that came to me made a broader statement that
1:41:26
his permanent protective detail for years now have been asking for more is
1:41:33
that correct I do not have specific incidents of those requests is it
1:41:39
correct that they've been asking for more I have heard the same reports that you have uh without having them in front
1:41:47
of me I unable those requests are made in writing I mean the agents are telling me they make them in writing this this
1:41:52
isn't a verbal agency things are made in writing I understand what you're saying I don't have those requests in front of
1:41:58
me here to I'm not asking if you have them in front of you are you aware that they were made as I said earlier there
1:42:03
are times when requests are made and depending on the availability of assets or if there is a way that so there were
1:42:09
times when they were denied if there is a way that that uh vulnerability can be mitigated in a different way then that
1:42:16
is why the there are times when they were denied for a variety of reasons that is why the secret service has a
1:42:22
multi layered and multifaceted security plan so that we can pivot if we so in
1:42:28
the wake I mean in the immediate 48 Hours of an assassination attempt on a former president could be the next
1:42:35
leader of the Free World almost had his head blown off your boss says that's
1:42:40
irresponsible and false to say things are denied and you had talk to him so did he just make that on his own make
1:42:46
that up on his own or did you tell him that we were speaking about the requests made at the rally
1:42:53
uh staff can we show the next slide please then we have your spokesman did
1:42:59
you sign off on this statement that there's an assertion that
1:43:05
a member of the former president's team requested additional security resources and those were rebuffed this is
1:43:11
absolutely false in fact we added Pro protective resources in technology and
1:43:16
capability as part of the increased campaign travel Tempo but next slide please
1:43:25
next SL please staff we have the Washington Post article that then says we now have senior Secret Service
1:43:32
officials saying there were in times at times when it was denied so which is it
1:43:40
again there have been a number of conversations going on here did you sign off on that spokesman's statement the spokesman statement I believe was
1:43:46
related to requests that were made for did you sign off on it for the requests that were made at the rally did you sign
1:43:52
off on the state before it went out I sign off on my press spokesman statement before they go out I would hope you would in the wake of an assassination
1:43:58
attempt yes you did MH categorically false that any requests
1:44:04
were made you signed off on it thank you for that uh thank you for that
1:44:11
Clarity Madam director how many press conferences have you held since the assassination attempt we have put out uh
1:44:17
press releas how many press conferences have you held gone to the mic taken questions from the public from the
1:44:24
media how many I have not held any how many has your how many has secretary
1:44:29
mayorcas held I don't zero how many has the FBI
1:44:34
held zero how many has the Department of Justice
1:44:40
held I know you know the answer I believe there was a press
1:44:45
conference uh in Butler after the incident occurred by local law enforcement
1:44:53
not by you and not by the Department of Homeland Security so this is how
1:44:59
misinformation flies I mean in the darkness in the absence of information
1:45:05
now we have nine days later before a congressional committee we all represent almost a million people and you still
1:45:11
don't have answers are you aware that national news anchors are saying this was a hoax on National Television they're
1:45:18
saying no the president wasn't shot it was flying glass are you aware of that I have not heard those reports are you
1:45:24
aware that I mean there are rumors rampant online that there were multiple Shooters yes are you aware that because
1:45:32
the shooter had overseas encrypted Platforms in Belgium and New Zealand and in Germany that a lot of people are
1:45:40
speculating there could have been foreign involvement logically are you aware of that yes and did have you done
1:45:45
anything to disabuse any of these Notions today no you haven't
1:45:53
Madame director I would fire you regardless of the failure I would fire you just how you've handled it since you
1:45:59
should have been the first to the mics to say America world I want to assure
1:46:04
you we're going to get to the bottom of this I want to assure you full transparency uh our agency clearly had
1:46:10
major gaps here and I want to personally take responsibility and accountability
1:46:15
you should have been the first standing alongside secretary secretary my orcus
1:46:21
and I would even go so far as to say have daily press conferences updating
1:46:26
everyone on what we know but you haven't had any of that what are you hiding behind I am not hiding because you're
1:46:32
making the situation worse I think you've heard that on a bipartisan basis here you are making this situation far
1:46:39
worse in the absence of information uh let's move
1:46:45
on this is truly astounding I want to be clear because you keep dodging the issue
1:46:51
has president Trump's permanent protective detail requested additional
1:46:57
assets over the last few years he is clearly not your average former president he's not Jimmy Carter in an
1:47:02
old folks home he's not President Bush painting uh out in his barn he has
1:47:07
multiple residences a lot of rallies he's very publicly engaged and he has a
1:47:14
foreign threat in addition to domestic threats have they requested additional resources that's the last question but
1:47:21
please feel free to director we have continued as I stated earlier to increase uh over the past year uh the
1:47:29
assets that are at the former president's residence and uh suppli to his detail Mr chairman if I could just
1:47:35
ask for one more Indulgence it is clear you'd have not been to Butler Pennsylvania leaders lead and should be
1:47:41
on the ground you have not been there instead you went to the RNC but you weren't originally even
1:47:47
going to go there where were you originally scheduled to go besides the RNC a national special security inent I
1:47:53
was always scheduled to go to uh Mr chairman I would like to enter into the record that the director was scheduled
1:47:58
to go to Aspen hobnobbing around with I don't I don't know who what liberal
1:48:04
Elites go to Aspen that was where you originally scheduled to go to speak at a forum I was scheduled to go to the RNC I
1:48:11
was going to leave the RNC for 24 hours and return back to the
1:48:17
RNC I hope as your predecessor Julie Pearson with a security incident on the
1:48:22
White House and under the Obama Administration and Reagan SEC Secret Service detailed lead I will hope you
1:48:29
would have the dignity for the sake of the agents in the service to resign gentlemen's time's expired thank you
1:48:35
like to enter a few things into the record uh first of all the remaining articles that Mr Bigs was uh wanting to
1:48:43
enter into the record without objection so ordered next I have a written statement from representative Mike Kelly
1:48:50
of Pennsylvania his district uh includes Butler H and
1:48:57
uh he has a written statement that we'd like to enter into the record without objection so ordered a bipartisan 114th
1:49:04
Congressional report titled United States Secret Service and agency in crisis this was prepared by former
1:49:10
oversight committee chairman Jason chaitz and former ranking member Elijah cumins and lastly uh the issue
1:49:17
subpoenaed compelling director cheo's appearance at today's hearing without objection so ordered that concludes uh
1:49:25
our question segment I want to thank the director for your testimony today I now
1:49:32
yield to the ranking member for closing remarks thank you very much Mr chairman
1:49:38
um and director Cheeto also want to thank you for your your patience um over
1:49:44
the course of what must have been a very long and trying uh uh hearing for you uh
1:49:51
it has been an unus usually encouraging hearing and an unusually depressing hearing and what's encouraging Mr
1:49:58
chairman is that we came together to issue a strong statement deploring and categorically denouncing political
1:50:05
violence in America and I also didn't see any daylight between the members of
1:50:11
the two parties today at the hearing in terms of our bafflement and outrage about the shocking operational failures
1:50:19
that led to disaster and near catastroph on July 13th
1:50:25
2024 uh what is depressing is the extraordinary Communications gap between
1:50:30
the director of The Secret Service and Congress um and I don't want to add to
1:50:37
the director's uh Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day um but I I will be
1:50:44
joining the chairman in uh calling for the resignation of the director just
1:50:50
because I think that this relationship is um irretrievable at this point and I
1:50:55
think that uh the director has lost the confidence of Congress um at a very
1:51:01
urgent and tender moment in the history of the country and we need to very quickly move Beyond this but what I will
1:51:08
say Mr chairman is that I took this hearing to be about two major policy
1:51:14
failures and one policy failure is the one that got the vast majority of the attention which was the failure of the
1:51:20
Secret Service to uh effectively respond to a gunman on a
1:51:27
roof within 150 yards of a presidential
1:51:32
visit and speech um but the other failure is on the part of Congress
1:51:38
because the mass shooting that took place in Butler Pennsylvania um is replicated all over
1:51:46
the country every day and in fact as I said Mr chairman it happened that
1:51:51
evening um in Alabama in Birmingham Alabama where there was a mass shooting
1:51:56
where more people even were killed and wounded than were killed and wounded in Butler Pennsylvania so it's true the
1:52:03
president the former president the handful of people who get the Secret Service protection are the only people
1:52:09
in America we thought were safe from an AR-15 attack it's clear that they're not
1:52:14
safe either and we've got to get to the bottom of that but we also have to get to the bottom of the larger problem
1:52:21
which is that the whole country is living like this in fear and in Terror
1:52:26
of assault weapon attacks in movie theaters churches synagogues mosques
1:52:32
supermarkets Walmarts um you know any place where an
1:52:38
audience or a public gathers and um the worst was in Las Vegas where a gunman
1:52:44
got up on a roof and then just uh mowed down 60 people uh below him and wounded
1:52:50
hundreds and hundreds of other people so we've got to deal with that problem we
1:52:56
yes we've got to move as swiftly as we can to deal with the problems of the Secret Service but the broader problem
1:53:03
is still there and I just wish to uh the
1:53:08
heavens that our colleagues that could get together on the question of presidential
1:53:14
security against an AR-15 attack could get together on the question of public
1:53:19
security against an AR-15 attack because all of us are vulnerable all of our
1:53:25
families are in danger by this and the rest of the world doesn't live this way
1:53:30
and we have to look to see how uniquely strange it is that we allow 20year olds
1:53:35
to access AR-15s weapons of mass destruction and show up in public places
1:53:41
to endanger other people and I hope Mr chairman we can work together on that with the same Spirit of bipartisan
1:53:49
commitment to the public safety that was exemplified here today and I yield back to you uh Rec member yields back uh I'll
1:53:56
deliver my closing remarks director cheel I subed you to appear today to get
1:54:01
answers for the American people about the failures that led to the assassination attempt of President
1:54:07
Donald J Trump unfortunately you refused to answer
1:54:13
today and this committee is not known for uh its bipartisan his model of
1:54:20
bipartisanship but I think to today we came together unanimously in
1:54:26
our disappointment for your lack of answers uh you've stated that the the
1:54:32
FBI will investigate and and give a report and you estimate 60 days we've
1:54:38
been waiting for months and months for lots of different uh bits of information
1:54:45
from the FBI we have no confidence in the FBI the majority of this committee has no confidence in the FBI
1:54:53
I sincerely hoped that the hearing today would give not just Congress confidence
1:55:00
in the Secret Service but the American people would have confidence in the
1:55:06
Secret Service we don't have confidence not just in Congress but I don't believe the American people tonight when they go
1:55:13
to bed are going to have confidence that the Secret Service is is the best it can be at
1:55:21
Protecting President Biden at protecting the first lady at Protecting President Trump at protecting their families
1:55:28
that's what the primary role for the Secret Service should be and some people have said and speculated well there
1:55:34
needs to be more money and more employees as I stated early on 3.1
1:55:39
billion I believe next year it's going to be $3.2 billion budget over 8,000
1:55:45
employees if the Secret Service is spread too thin and doing things like uh inspecting counterfeit which is what the
1:55:51
secret was created to do was to to inspect counterfeit money and things like that with the treasury if it spread
1:55:58
to thin then we need to come together in Congress and I think we can do that in a in a bipartisan way to narrow the focus
1:56:05
of the Secret Service to protect the leaders of our country to
1:56:11
protect our elections by protecting our our candidates and I don't believe we have any confidence that that you can do
1:56:18
that as the leader of the FBI I I sincerely hope that we would adjourn
1:56:25
this Committee hearing and have confidence not just in in in the Secret Service but in in in you as director of
1:56:32
The Secret Service but we but we do not taking
1:56:39
responsibility requires a lot of things it means providing transparency uh it means answering
1:56:45
simple questions it means providing a specific timeline of July 13th to this
1:56:51
committee and the American people it means it's been nine days there were people that uh were demanding that we
1:56:56
have a hearing the the next day or or two days following the the shooting and I said no we need to give the Secret
1:57:02
Service ample time to be able to answer those questions nine days nine days and
1:57:10
I don't think we answered very many questions that the American people have I don't think there was a qu I've never said this before and I've presided over
1:57:17
a lot of hearings I don't think there was one question asked by anyone
1:57:22
that that the average American hasn't already asked at a diner or at church or
1:57:28
at a ball game the American people have questions they deserve answers Congress
1:57:33
deserves answers you were subpoenaed today to provide answers and ma'am you
1:57:38
did not do that so as as ranking member Rasin
1:57:44
stated he and I will be sending a letter uh requesting that you submit your
1:57:49
resignation as a step toward a accountability in uh in what happened
1:57:55
and one of the biggest frustrations that many of us have especially on this side of the aisle is that there's never
1:58:01
accountability in this Administration and when you look at the at the debacles prior to July 13th I mean it would be
1:58:09
hard to beat the withdrawal in Afghanistan the debaca there and no one was held accountable to this day no one
1:58:15
has been held accountable for that but here we have clearly video showing
1:58:21
people notifying the police and the police are blaming the Secret Service the Secret Service are blaming the
1:58:26
police Homeland Security is blaming everybody but at the end of the day
1:58:32
after this hearing and after our request for information we don't have any
1:58:38
answers for the American people and we don't have that confidence that you can lead the Secret Service to restore the
1:58:51
confidence
1:59:21
e e
2:00:03
okay
2:00:47
best
2:01:03
Serv
2:01:50

e e
2:04:36
minut
2:05:20
know e
2:06:11
you
2:06:32
want to welcome everyone here today and I know we also want to welcome speaker Johnson uh who is also uh in attendance
2:06:39
today without objection the chair May declare recess at any time I now uh recognize myself for the
2:06:47
purpose of making a note statement but first
2:06:53
without objection uh representative Mills of Florida and representative Miller of Ohio are waved on to the
2:06:59
committee for the purpose of questioning the witness at today's hearing without
2:07:04
objection to order good morning today's hearing is for the American people who are seeking
2:07:10
answers about the attempted assassination of President Trump a little over a week ago American wa
2:07:16
Americans watched in horror as a shooter attempted to assassinate president Donald J Trump at a campaign rally in
2:07:23
Butler Pennsylvania the gunman nearly succeeded the bullet that struck president Trump's head was less than an
2:07:30
inch from taking his life president Trump survived but one rally goer Corey
2:07:37
comparator tragically did not two others were seriously injured it was a
2:07:44
horrifying moment in American history the horror was exceeded only by The Bravery of the law enforcement agents
2:07:50
who threw themselves in Harmon way when shots were fired The Bravery of a crowd unwavering in its refusal to panic and
2:07:57
The Bravery of a bloody president Trump refusing to run while we give overwhelming thanks to
2:08:05
the individual Secret Service agents who did their jobs under immense pressure
2:08:10
this tragedy was preventable the secret Services protective mission is to protect us en
2:08:18
visiting world leaders and Safeguard us elections through protection of candidates and
2:08:24
nominees the secret service has a zerof fail Mission but it failed on July 13th
2:08:31
and in the days leading up to the rally the secret service has thousands of
2:08:37
employees and a significant budget but it has now become the face of
2:08:43
incompetence the committee has a long track record of providing oversight of the Secret Service our predecessors both
2:08:51
Jason chaitz and Elijah Cummings among others work together to issue warnings and recommendations to address obvious
2:08:58
shortcomings in the agency's makeup and operations unfortunately those warnings
2:09:03
and recommendations have gone unheeded a former president and current
2:09:09
candidate for president was shot in the head by a sniper within 500 feet of the
2:09:15
podium this is unacceptable and we are concerned the Secret Service lacks the
2:09:20
proper management to keep protectees safe from Bad actors Americans demand answers but they
2:09:28
have not been getting them from the Secret Service we are instead learning about new facts about the events
2:09:35
surrounding the attempted assassination every day from whistleblowers and
2:09:41
leaks Americans demand accountability but no one is yet to be fired for this
2:09:47
historic failure today's witness secret Serv director Kimberly cheel is here
2:09:54
under subpoena to answer questions about how the agency failed president Trump and the victims who attended the rally
2:10:01
in Butler Pennsylvania it is my firm belief director cheel that you should
2:10:07
resign however in complete Defiance director cheel has maintained she will not tender her resignation therefore she
2:10:14
will answer questions today from members of this committee seeking to provide Clarity to the American people about how
2:10:19
these events were allowed to transpire we will ask these questions because the
2:10:25
Secret Service and its parent agency the Department of Homeland Security have been unwilling to provide answers to the
2:10:31
American people DHS has sought to push this hearing to a different time secret
2:10:37
service has suggested the hearing occur without media presence and both agencies
2:10:42
have provided only shallow explanations to Congress about what happened on July
2:10:48
13th indeed DHS and Secret Services lack of communication with the oversight
2:10:53
committee required me to issue a subpoena compelling director cheel to
2:10:58
attend today and still DHS requested compelling director to attend today and
2:11:03
still DHS requested more time to prepare it shouldn't take this much time
2:11:09
or Preparation those warnings recomendations I'm thankful to the ranking member Mr Rasin for
2:11:15
joining C president the I disagree on
2:11:21
feet but that does not matter today this the safety of secret service protectees is not based on their political
2:11:28
affiliation and the bottom line is that under director Kel's leadership we question whether anyone is safe not
2:11:36
President Biden not the first lady not the White House and certainly not the
2:11:41
presidential candidates the July 13th assassination attempt is one of the darkest days in American political
2:11:48
history it represents the ugliest parts of what American politics has become
2:11:53
hatred of each other and a dangerous turn to extremism before we were Republicans Or
2:11:59
democrats we are Americans if we place our political affiliations above our duty and love of country we cannot
2:12:06
maintain a country we must ensure our Republic is strong and our Republic
2:12:12
cannot be strong when our leadership our elections our institutions and our candidates are threatened by extremism
2:12:20
and violence today director cheetah will answer questions about why she deserves to continue to play a critical role in
2:12:26
preserving this country's safety and at the very least what led to the catastrophic deadly events on July 13th
2:12:35
in Butler Pennsylvania again I do not believe director Ketel deserves to maintain her position as head of the Secret Service
2:12:41
but members of the America and the American people will make their own decisions based on her answers today I
2:12:48
urge director cheel to be transparent and forthcoming in her test testimony today Americans deserve no less we have
2:12:55
a duty to find out how this happened and to ensure it never happens again I now
2:13:03
yield to ranking member Rasin for his opening statement thank you kindly chairman comr uh Elijah Cummings whose
2:13:10
beautiful Visage looks down upon us taught us that the way to find common ground in a crisis is to look for the
2:13:17
higher ground and last week chairman comr and I came together to reach for that Higher Ground we made a joint
2:13:23
statement condemning the mass shooting and assassination attempt against former president Trump as a grave assault on
2:13:30
our democracy as we wrote We are united in condemning all political violence I
2:13:36
join the good chairman in expressing condolences to the family of Corey comparator and in sending healing wishes
2:13:43
to the wounded victims also of this atrocious act of violence some are
2:13:48
calling it a miracle that former president president Trump escaped this AR-15 attack unlike so many thousands of
2:13:55
our fellow citizens who have been killed or seriously wounded in other AR-15
2:14:01
shootings whether this miracle is of Divine Providence or of an adventitious nature will be up to each of us to
2:14:08
ponder but our job in Congress is not simply to Marvel at Miracles or count on good luck but to act as public policy
2:14:15
legislators to do whatever we can to prevent future political violence
2:14:21
attempted assassinations and mass shootings the chairman and I are thus determined to get to the bottom of the
2:14:27
stunning security failures that enabled this 20-year-old lone gunman who
2:14:32
borrowed his father's AR-15 to perpetrate a mass shooting and assassination attempt at an event
2:14:38
protected by the Secret Service as well as state and local police we'll ask hard
2:14:43
questions of director cheel today in order to identify and understand the shocking security failures that occurred
2:14:50
and to to help transform the operations of the Secret Service to prevent anything like this from happening again
2:14:57
but we can't let ourselves off the hook either dear colleagues what happened in Butler Pennsylvania was a double failure
2:15:03
the failure by the Secret Service to properly protect former president Trump and the failure of Congress to properly
2:15:09
protect our people from Criminal gun violence we must therefore also ask hard questions about whether our laws are
2:15:16
making it too easy for potential assassins to obtain firearm generally in
2:15:21
the AR-15 specifically Mr comparator former president Trump and the other
2:15:27
rally attendees wounded in Butler are now members of a club no one wants to belong to the thousands of people who
2:15:33
have fallen victim to mass shootings last year we had 655 mass shootings in America defined as
2:15:41
four or more people being shot or killed in a single event not including the shooter 712 people died and nearly 2700
2:15:48
people were wounded in these attacks in 2023 mass shootings are commonplace they
2:15:54
happen at political rallies and constituent meetings in our elementary schools middle schools and high schools
2:16:00
in churches synagogues and mosques and movie theaters and parades and nightclubs and grocery stores in
2:16:06
concerts and on street corners here are the worst mass shootings in the last uh
2:16:12
11 or 12 years the list is a grim reminder of the horrific damage and
2:16:18
death wrought by assault weapons in the air R15 in particular that have taken the lives of our children parents
2:16:25
colleagues and neighbors this is a a a very partial list mass shootings have
2:16:31
become so frequent that we don't even hear about them anymore since the mass shooting in Butler there have already
2:16:38
been at least 10 additional mass shootings in America Two of which took
2:16:43
place the same day that former president Trump was targeted one of the mass
2:16:48
shootings on that violent Saturday July 13th happened at 11:00 p.m. at a
2:16:54
nightclub in Birmingham Alabama where four people were shot dead and 10 others wounded this means amazingly that the
2:17:01
butler attack was not even the deadliest mass shooting to happen in America on that
2:17:07
day a weapon that can be used to commit a mass shooting in an event under the full protection of the Secret Service
2:17:13
together with dozens of state and local police is obviously an intolerable threat to the rest of us who do not
2:17:20
receive such protection and obviously does not belong in our communities it's time to pass Universal background checks
2:17:26
and build on this administration's work to ensure that we permanently close the loopholes in The Brady Law for gun show
2:17:33
purchases online purchases and Private Sales to prevent those weapons from getting into the hands of people we know
2:17:40
to be a threat to others what happened in Butler shows why even closing these loopholes however
2:17:47
will not keep assault weapons out of the hands of potential assassins and Mass murderers under federal law and in the
2:17:53
vast majority of States even young people not old enough to buy a beer legally can legally purchase and own the
2:18:00
AR-15 and carried in public the shooter and Butler used his father's AR-15 we
2:18:06
have to find the courage and resolve to pass a ban on the AR-15 and other assault weapons a ban is Broad support
2:18:12
even the New York Post loudly endorsed such a ban in 2019 we have passed an assault weapons
2:18:19
ban before Republicans and Democrats together passed it in 1994 alas in 2004
2:18:27
we allowed the ban to expire we know this weapons ban worked one study found
2:18:32
that in the decade that followed the Ban's lapse mass shootings went back up
2:18:38
183% and deaths from mass shootings went up 239 per. but even as we Chang the
2:18:44
Secret Service and act to ban weapons of war like the AR-15 we still will have fallen short of our duty if we fail to
2:18:51
denounce every instance of politically motivated violence in whatever form it takes Republicans and Democrats again
2:18:58
have come together to denounce this assassination attempt just as we did the Violent attempts on the lives of our
2:19:04
colleagues Representative Steven scales and representative Gabby gords and on Paul Pelosi the husband of speaker Nancy
2:19:12
Pelosi who was attacked and brutalized in his home and in the immediate aftermath of the January 6th Mass
2:19:17
violence waged against Congress and the vice president and the Constitutional transfer of power Democrats and
2:19:23
Republicans alike including Senator McConnell chairman comr and other colleagues all denounced this violent
2:19:29
assault on our democracy that wounded approximately 140 officers from the US
2:19:35
Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department and I commend them for
2:19:41
acting to uh denounce that attack just as Democrats moved swiftly to denounce
2:19:47
the attack on Congressman kise m police police scientists political scientists
2:19:53
tell us that authoritarian attacks on Democratic institutions begin with political parties refusing to disavow or
2:20:00
openly embracing political violence we have to reject that on a strong bipartisan basis as chairman comr and I
2:20:06
have done even as we ensure our secret service is up to its vital task of protecting presidents and candidates and
2:20:13
as we work to ensure that America the streets of our country are free from the violence of weapons of war thank you Mr
2:20:19
chairman and I yeld back to you thank you gentleman yields back today we are joined by Kimberly cheel who was

2:22:19
opportunity to appear before you today today the assassination attempt of former president Donald Trump on July
2:22:24
13th is the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades
2:22:31
and I am keeping him and his family in my thoughts I would like to offer my sincerest condolences to the family of
2:22:37
Corey comparator a former Fire Chief and a hero who was killed in this senseless
2:22:43
shooting I would also like to acknowledge those who were injured in Butler David Dutch and James copenh
2:22:49
Haven and I wish them a speedy recovery I would be remiss if I did not also extend my condolences on the passing of
2:22:56
your colleague congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee Miss Jackson Lee was always engaged in the oversight of the Secret
2:23:02
Service and her passing is a great loss to this body the secret service's solemn mission
2:23:08
is to protect our nation's leaders on July 13th we failed as a director of the
2:23:15
United States Secret Service I take full responsibility for any security lap
2:23:21
of our agency we are fully cooperating with ongoing investigations we must learn what
2:23:27
happened and I will move Heaven and Earth to ensure that an incident like July 13th does not happen again let me
2:23:35
State unequivocally nothing I have said should be interpreted to place blame for this
2:23:41
failure on our federal state or local law enforcement Partners who supported the Secret Service in Butler we could
2:23:48
not do our job without them we rely on the relationships built over years of working together to secure events and
2:23:54
conduct investigations our agents officers and support Personnel understand that every
2:24:00
day we are expected to sacrifice Our Lives to execute a no- fail
2:24:06
Mission as witnessed on July 13th our special agents shielded former president
2:24:12
Trump with their own bodies on stage while shots were being
2:24:17
fired selflessly willing to make the ultimate sacrifice without hesitation I
2:24:22
am proud beyond words of the actions taken by the former president's detail the counter sniper team who neutralized
2:24:28
the gunman and the Tactical Team who was prepared to act I will be transparent as
2:24:34
possible when I speak with you understanding though at times that I may be limited in providing a thorough
2:24:41
response in this open setting due to Associated risks with sharing highly
2:24:46
sensitive protective methodologies I do not want to inadvertently provide you today with inaccurate
2:24:52
information since January 1st 2024 the secret service has successfully secured
2:24:58
over 7500 sites every protective Advance comes with its own set of challenges and
2:25:03
requires a customized mitigation strategy including specific assets security plans are multi-layered
2:25:10
providing 360 degrees of protection these layers include Personnel Technical
2:25:17
and tactical assets which are a force multiplier for our protective posture
2:25:22
during every Advance we attempt to strike a balance between enabling the protecte to be visible and our
2:25:29
protective requirements to be secure I know this because I have spent 29 years
2:25:35
in this agency I came up through the ranks I've secured events for every president since President Clinton
2:25:41
supervised on vice president Cheney detail leted our training center oversaw all of the investigations and protective
2:25:48
visits in the state of Georgia supervised on Vice President Biden's detail and the agency's entire
2:25:54
protective Mission during the Trump Administration the comprehensive advanced process involves collaborative
2:26:01
planning between our secret service the protectees staff local law enforcement
2:26:06
partners and the level of security provided for the former president increased well before the campaign and
2:26:13
has been steadily increasing as threats evolve the security plan included a full
2:26:19
assessment of the butler armed show showgrounds to identify security vulnerabilities and craft a security
2:26:25
plan for the protecte attendees and the public immediately following the
2:26:30
assassination attempt I directed the activation of my crisis center I assembled my executive team to begin
2:26:36
surging more protective resources to the former president and to ensure the wellness of our people post incident all
2:26:42
while securing an active crime scene I immediately ordered a re-evaluation of the Republican National Convention
2:26:48
security plan and I increased the security posture in the national capital region for all permanent protectees and
2:26:54
sites at the same time I initiated a mission Assurance investigation within our agency I have instructed my team
2:27:02
that all necessary resources will be dedicated to investigating these manners we will not rest until we have explored
2:27:09
every option and we will leave no stone unturned but I want to be clear I am not
2:27:15
waiting for these investigations to be completed prior to making changes over the past 2 weeks we successfully led the
2:27:22
planning and execution of the 75th NATO Summit and the Republican National Convention over the next few months we
2:27:28
will Implement security plans for the Democratic National Convention the United Nations General Assembly and have
2:27:33
already begun planning and coordinating the 2025 inauguration it is now more important
2:27:38
than ever for the men and women of the Secret Service to remain resilient and to focus on what is necessary to carry
2:27:45
out our critical Mission our agency needs to be adequately resourced in order to serve our current Mission
2:27:51
requirements and anticipate future requirements the Secret Service currently protects 36 individuals on a
2:27:57
daily basis as well as world leaders who visit the United States like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who
2:28:03
arrived in Washington DC today the coming years will bring an unprecedented heavy protection Tempo I have no doubt
2:28:11
that the processes that I have imple implemented during my tenure as director in addition to my nearly 30 years of
2:28:17
experience in this agency have positioned the secret service to be stronger our mission is not political it
2:28:24
is literally a matter of life and death and the tragic events on July 13th remind us of that I have full confidence
2:28:32
in the men and women of the Secret Service they are worthy of our support and executing our protective Mission I
2:28:38
will now answer any questions that the committee may have thank you very much director cheel we'll now begin our our
2:28:44
five minutes uh questions and I will begin just for the record the secret
2:28:50
service has a annual budget of around $3.1 billion do and I believe around
2:28:56
8,000 employees is that correct yes sir obviously there were many security failures on the day of the attempted
2:29:03
assassination and leading up to that day let's start with the building that the shooter used to shoot president Trump
2:29:08
from at any point Saturday did the Secret Service have an agent on top of
2:29:13
that roof sir I'm sure as you can imagine that we are just nine days out from this
2:29:20
uh incident and there's still an ongoing investigation and so I want to make sure that any information that we are
2:29:27
providing to you is you can't okay why did the Secret Service not can you answer why the Secret Service didn't
2:29:32
place a single agent on the roof we are still looking into the advanced process and the decisions that
2:29:39
were made okay okay let's wasn't that building within the
2:29:44
perimeter that should be secured do we agree with that the building was outside of the
2:29:51
perimeter on the day of the visit but again that is one of the things that during the investigation we want to take
2:29:56
a look at and determine whether or not other decisions should have been made one of the things that you said I
2:30:03
believe in an interview that there wasn't an agent on the roof because it was a slope roof is that is that normal
2:30:10
and do you fear that that immediately creates an opportunity for future
2:30:15
wouldbe assassins to look for a slanted roof I mean it is this is huge question
2:30:21
that every American has why wasn't a secret service agent on the roof and there have been reports that agents were
2:30:27
supposed to be on the roof but it was hot that day and they didn't want to be on the roof can you answer any of those questions director so I appreciate you
2:30:34
asking me that question chairman uh I should have been more clear in my answer when I spoke about where we place
2:30:40
Personnel in that interview uh what I can tell you is that uh there was a plan in place to provide OverWatch and we are
2:30:47
still looking into responsibilities and who was going to provide OverWatch uh but the Secret Service in general not
2:30:54
speaking specifically to this incident when we are providing OverWatch whether that be through counter snipers or other
2:31:01
technology prefer to have sterile rooftops did the Secret Service use any
2:31:06
drones for surveillance that day so again I'm not going to get into specifics of that day in itself but
2:31:13
there are times uh during a security plan that the Secret Service does deploy an asset like a drone there were reports
2:31:19
that the shooter used a drone just a few hours before the rally start time is
2:31:24
that accurate I have heard those same reports and again am waiting for the final
2:31:30
report do you know if you can't answer the question that's your answer but can you
2:31:36
answer this do you know do you know I'm not asking yes or no but do you know if
2:31:42
the shooter used a drone before the shooting that information has been
2:31:48
passed to us from the FBI how many Secret Service agents were assigned to president Trump on the day
2:31:53
of the rally again I'm not going to get into the specifics of the numbers of personnel that we had there but we feel
2:32:02
that there was a sufficient number of Agents assigned there are reports that several agents assigned to the rally on
2:32:07
July 13th were were temporary agents agents not normally assigned to president Trump is that
2:32:13
accurate what I can tell you is that the agents that were assigned to former president Trump are Secret Service
2:32:20
agents that provide close protection to him and that was what was actual on that
2:32:25
day how many temporary agents were there that day quite frequently sir during campaign
2:32:31
events uh the Secret Service utilizes uh Agents from HSI or the Department of
2:32:37
Homeland Security you don't know how many supplement our plan have the investigators reconstructed the
2:32:43
shooter's precise movements over the past days weeks and months so
2:32:50
we need we need to have confidence that if the FBI is leading this investigation that they're leading a
2:32:58
credible investigation because there's some of us sitting up here today that don't have a lot of confidence in the FBI so I will repeat the question have
2:33:05
the investigators reconstructed the shooters precise moments over the past days weeks and months I understand your
2:33:11
question chairman and I share your concerns about wanting to make sure that we have factual information the FBI is
2:33:18
conducting a criminal investigation the Secret Service is conducting an internal investigation there are a number of oig
2:33:24
Investigations and there is the external investigation the last question for me
2:33:30
before July 13th had the Trump detail requested additional
2:33:35
resources what I can tell you is that for the event on July 13th the details
2:33:40
that were request the the assets that were requested for that day were given okay my time has expired chair no
2:33:48
recognize as ranking member asking for five minutes thank you Mr chairman um it's been um reported that before former
2:33:56
president Trump got up on the stage at around 6:00 p.m. on Saturday July 13th
2:34:01
that the local police had identified and even photographed a man who was acting
2:34:07
suspiciously and this man who turned out to be the gunman had been flagged as a Potential Threat is that
2:34:14
accurate what I can say is that the individual was identified as suspicious
2:34:21
so he was known to be suspicious before former president Trump took this stage
2:34:27
that is the information I have received why was he allowed to take the stage with a suspicious person having been
2:34:34
identified in the crime so I appreciate the question and I'd like to make two points if the detail had been past
2:34:42
information that there was a threat the detail would never have brought the former president out onto stage that is
2:34:49
what we do and that is who we are we are charged with protecting uh all all of
2:34:54
our protectees so you distinguish between someone who is suspicious and someone who's threatening is that right
2:35:00
do there are a number of times at protective events where suspicious people are identified and those
2:35:05
individuals have to be investigated and determined what is it that identifies
2:35:11
that person as suspicious so did you deny um a request for additional
2:35:16
resources that had been made by uh the Trump campaign there were no assets denied for that
2:35:23
event in Butler on the 13th I see so you're saying there were requests made
2:35:29
for additional assistance for other specific events rather than for the campaign as a whole is that right I'm
2:35:36
sorry I'm not understanding well you seem to say that there were not additional resources requested for that
2:35:41
event and uh forgive me for being unfamiliar with this is it requested
2:35:47
event by event or is it requested just in general for the campaign so if I can explain the
2:35:54
advanced process uh when the when a an event or in a venue is identified by in
2:36:00
this case campaign staff uh then the campaign staff works together with Secret Service agents who go out and
2:36:07
conduct in advance generally that is a five-day time period uh where those discussions are had about what the
2:36:13
perimeter is going to look like what the size of the event is what the venue is and then from there uh is a request made
2:36:21
uh to mitigate potential risk and threat and I'm saying that on that day the
2:36:26
requests that were pushed forward were granted so the Secret Service did not know that the gunman actually had a
2:36:32
weapon before President Trump was allowed to get up on the stage to the best of our knowledge and the facts that
2:36:38
we have at this point that is correct um so can you answer this question which I think is on the mind of
2:36:44
most Americans thinking about this how can a 20-year-old with his father's AR-15 assault weapon climb onto a roof
2:36:52
with a direct 150 yard line of sight to the speakers Podium without the Secret
2:36:59
Service or local police stopping him so again sir I will say we are nine days
2:37:04
out from this event and I would like to know those answers as well which is why
2:37:09
we are going through these investigations to be able to determine that fully okay um it's been reported
2:37:16
that the shooter was not carrying a driver's license or any form of
2:37:21
identification um they had no idea who he was but then he was quickly identified I think within 30 minutes by
2:37:29
using the serial number on the AR-15 um under a tracing system that is
2:37:36
now controversial some people say we should get rid of it some people want to keep it but is that right that the serial number was the key information
2:37:45
which led to the identification of the shooter that is my understanding sir yes
2:37:51
okay um if if an American citizen were just to
2:37:58
stop you and say director cheel we support your work to the tune of billions of dollars and thousands and
2:38:04
thousands of employees what went wrong what would you say again knowing that we're nine days
2:38:11
out I would say as I have said from the very outset I accept responsibility for this tragedy uh we are going to look
2:38:19
into how this happened and we are going to take corrective action to ensure that it never happens again well I appreciate
2:38:27
that um and and I hope you will act with Vigor and focus and intensity and it
2:38:32
seems you understand the the gravity and solemnity of this to the American people um millions and millions of Americans
2:38:38
don't feel safe with all the AR-15s out there we thought at least the president of the United States or a former president of the United States would be
2:38:44
safe but now that's not even clear Mr chairman I yield back to you gentlemen here's back chair now recognize chairman
2:38:50
of the house Judiciary Committee Mr Jordan from Ohio thank you Mr chairman director were you guessing or
2:38:56
lying the day after president Trump is shot Secret Service spokesman Anthony
2:39:01
gami said quote the assertion that a member of the former president's security team requested additional security resources that the US Secret
2:39:08
Service or the Department of Homeland Security rebuffed is absolutely false the next day secretary my orcus said
2:39:15
that is an unequivocally false assertion we had not received any request for additional security measures that were
2:39:21
rebuffed but 5 days later The Washington Post said this top officials repeatedly
2:39:28
rejected requests from Donald Trump's security detail for more Personnel the next day the New York Times said this Mr
2:39:35
gam acknowledged that the Secret Service had turned down some request for additional Federal Security assets for
2:39:42
Mr Trump's detail so which is it because both statements can't be true were you guessing or lying when you said you
2:39:49
didn't turn down request from president Trump's detail neither sir and I appreciate the
2:39:56
question what's what were you doing because those statements don't don't Jive so what I can tell you is that for
2:40:03
the event in Butler there were no requests that were denied as far as
2:40:08
requests well maybe they got tired of asking maybe you turned them down so darn much they said not worth asking how
2:40:15
many times did you turn him down ahead of that I think that it is important to to distinguish between what some people
2:40:21
may view as a denial uh of an asset or a request Mr goami your
2:40:28
spokesperson he said he acknowledged the Secret Service had turned down some requests I'm asking how many a denial of
2:40:36
a request does not equal a vulnerability well tell me what it is there are a number of ways that threats and risks
2:40:43
can be mitigate mitigated with a number of different assets whether that be through Personnel whether that be
2:40:51
through technology or other resour well tell the committee which it was they asked for additional help in some form
2:40:58
or another you told him no how many times did you tell them no and what' you tell them no
2:41:04
to again I cannot speak to specific incidents but I can tell you in general
2:41:09
terms uh the Secret Service uh is judicious with their resources based on
2:41:15
what does some requests mean how many times some indicate Quest is plural so more than once they asked for additional
2:41:21
help and you turned them down what they asked for and how many times did you turn them down pretty basic questions so
2:41:27
again without having all of the details in front of me sir what I can tell you is that there are times you didn't get
2:41:32
briefed on how many times you turned down the Trump detail when they asked for additional help I'm I'm sorry you didn't get briefed on that before you
2:41:38
came to this hearing knowing you were going to get asked that question what I can tell you is it in generic terms when
2:41:44
people when when details make a request there are times that there are alternate
2:41:50
ways to cover off on that threat or that risk that's not what he said he said they were denied certain requests some
2:41:56
request I this is your spokesperson not me talking this is the Secret Service talking and it what a change from
2:42:02
absolutely false unequivocally false to oh by the way there were some times where we didn't give them what they
2:42:08
wanted that's a huge change in five days and the fact that you can't answer how many times you did that that's pretty
2:42:15
darn frustrating not just for me but for for the country I hear your frustration let me ask you
2:42:21
this were any of those requests denied to president Trump's detail after you knew about the Iranian
2:42:27
threat what I can tell you again I don't know the specifics is that there are times when we can fill a request it
2:42:35
doesn't necessarily have to be with a Secret Service uh asset or resource we
2:42:41
can fill that request with locally available assets you spoke to anyone at the White House since July
2:42:46
13th yes I have who'd you talk to I have briefed the president and the vice president talked to the first lady
2:42:54
no I have not talked to the White House staff anyone in the White House communications no I have not have you
2:42:59
talked to the counter sniper who took the shot that took out the bad guy yes I have and can you tell us about that
2:43:05
conversation I would not want to reveal conversations that I've had with my employees but that's exactly the kind of
2:43:11
information the American people want to know American people who pay your salary I understand this is an ongoing
2:43:16
investigation and I who's all doing the investigating at secret service I know the Inspector General but is there also an internal investigation in addition to
2:43:22
the Inspector General we are conducting a mission Assurance investigation internally yes you know what it looks
2:43:29
like director looks like you won't answer some pretty basic questions it looks like you got a 9% raise and you cut Corners when it came to protecting
2:43:35
one of the most important individuals most well-known individuals on the planet a former president likely the guy's going to be the next president
2:43:41
looks like you guys were cutting Corners that's what it looks like to me is that true I am here today because I want to
2:43:46
answer questions but I also want to be you might want to but you haven't answered I don't think you've answered one question from the chairman the
2:43:52
ranking member or me we got a lot of other people asking we'll see if you're if your record improves but right now
2:43:58
you haven't answered I don't think any questions I yield back gentlemen yields back chair I Rec as Miss Norton from
2:44:04
Washington DC thank you Mr chairman um in the
2:44:10
summer of 1963 as a law student I traveled to the South to work in the
2:44:15
Civil Rights Movement when I arrived in Jackson Mississippi I was met by a civil
2:44:20
rights activist who showed me around town and tried to convince me to work in Jackson that summer I recall talking
2:44:28
with him and his wife about the raw at atmosphere in Jackson later that day he
2:44:34
took me to the bus station for my trip to my assignment that night he was
2:44:40
assassinated outside his home his name was megar ever I condemn the political
2:44:46
violence it is a threat to the democracy I want to discuss one of the roots of
2:44:52
political violence guns for years Republicans including a member of this
2:44:57
committee have introduced legislation and amendments to repeal or block the District of Columbia gun violence
2:45:05
protection laws including its bans on assault weapons and large capacity
2:45:10
magazines the shooter at the Trump rally used the mass Shooters gun of
2:45:18
choice an assault weapon specifically an AR-15 style rifle and presumably a large
2:45:28
capacity magazine which is defined in DC as a magazine that can hold more than 10
2:45:36
bullets under current DC law DC does not recognize Concealed Carry Permits issued
2:45:43
by other jurisdictions but it does uh issue conce
2:45:48
field Carry Permits to both residents and non-residents however DC imposes a
2:45:55
number of requirements on concealed carry applicants including suitability such as
2:46:02
not having exhibited a propensity for violence or instability moreover DC
2:46:09
residents where where the uh restricts where the guns can be carried such as a
2:46:15
political demonstration near the White House and Naval Observatory or near
2:46:21
people under Secret Service protection provided the permit holder has been
2:46:28
given notice this week the house is expected expected to consider the fiscal
2:46:34
year 2025 financial services and general government Appropriations
2:46:40
Bill uh this Republican drafted bill would allow an individual with a permit
2:46:48
to carry a concealed handgun issued by a state or
2:46:53
territory uh to carry a concealed
2:46:58
handgun n DC regardless of that jurisdiction's
2:47:04
permit requirements a republican has filed an amendment to that provision to allow
2:47:11
such an individual to carry a magazine of any size with that handgun in short
2:47:18
the pending Bill and Amendment would allow any person with a carry permit
2:47:24
issued by another jurisdiction to carry a concealed handgun with a magazine of
2:47:31
any size in any location in the district of Colombia the Secret Service is
2:47:38
responsible for protecting a large number of people and facilities in DC director CH chel uh would Secret
2:47:47
Service protect these NDC be safer or less safe if people who have exhibited a
2:47:56
propensity for violence or instability could carry a concealed uh concealed
2:48:02
handguns n DC I think being a secret service agent
2:48:09
and an officer or a law enforcement officer in any state is difficult they
2:48:15
are required to make decisions and snap judgment uh in the blink of an eye and I think
2:48:21
that the officers and the Agents that work here in the DC area do a great job
2:48:27
of monitoring uh the public and reacting to threats uh as appropriate when they
2:48:34
uh arise would would would SE Secret Service protect in DC be safer or less
2:48:41
safe if people in DC could carry concealed handguns with large capacity
2:48:48
magaz aines I think ma'am that we work in parameters where we travel around North
2:48:55
America and the rules on open carry and concealed carry are different from state
2:49:00
to state and that is part of what the Secret Service takes into account when we develop a security plan obviously
2:49:08
anyone that comes into one of our protective sites we would establish magnetometer support metal detectors
2:49:15
that Personnel would have to process through eliminating that potential uh would Secret Service protees in DC be
2:49:22
safer or less safe if more people could carry handguns uh
2:49:28
NDC I think again as I stated ma'am we want to make sure that we provide a safe environment for all of our protectees
2:49:35
and whatever measures we would need to put in place uh for a secure site we would do so I mat gentle ladies times
2:49:42
expired chair now recognizes the chairman of the house intelligence committee Mr Turner from Ohio director
2:49:48
Cheeto your opening statement indicates that the Secret Service constructed a security plan for the site in in Pennsylvania I'm assuming that security
2:49:54
plan would also include the security footprint for the site but it also would be based upon a threat assessment for
2:50:01
the risk threats associated with Donald Trump and the crowded attendance would it not include a threat assessment yes
2:50:08
it would so that threat assessment as we know um basically would have started
2:50:13
with as a generalized threat against Donald Trump because he is a presidential candidate then it would have gone to he's a former president and
2:50:20
he gets uh security coverage just as Bush Clinton Carter and Obama do and then you also have the heightened
2:50:25
political environment even for those it's clear that the security footprint
2:50:31
that the threat assessment was insufficient which permitted that a 20-year-old to actually enter with the weapon and shoot Donald Trump but I want
2:50:38
to ask you about two other aspects of the threat assessment it is known in public that Iran is a threat risk for
2:50:47
Donald Trump they're a threat risk for John Bolton former Secretary of State Pompeo and Donald Trump because they
2:50:53
have indicated they want to assassinate them as a result of retaliation for the killing of
2:50:59
salomani that is both for Iran a generalized threat they're targeting these individuals but also most recently
2:51:05
a specific threat to Donald Trump himself now I want to uh enter into the
2:51:11
record by UCC um a uh Department of Justice public affairs release a CNN
2:51:17
article a u an article from Fox News and an article
2:51:22
from CBS all of which acknowledge without objection to order that this threat exists for Donald Trump from Iran
2:51:29
and that there are specific threats most recently that have been acknowledged director Cheo have you read
2:51:35
the intelligence of the journalized threat to Donald Trump by Iran as a
2:51:41
result of their desire to retaliate for the killing of Salon excuse me Sal
2:51:46
Salomon I have um have you read or been briefed about
2:51:52
the intelligence of the specific recent threat to Donald Trump from Iran yes I
2:51:58
have director Ry when we were getting our briefing indicated that he thought the threat assessment should have
2:52:04
included this threat from Iran is it your testimony today that the threat
2:52:10
assessment since you've read this intelligence was sufficient to protect him from this threat from Iran
2:52:19
my testimony today is that the information that we had at the time was known uh that was it sufficient director
2:52:26
cheel was it sufficient for the Iranian threat that you said you have read the intelligence briefings for that
2:52:34
information was passed to well I'm not asking the bureaucratic issue of who did it get passed around to director cheel
2:52:41
was it sufficient for the specific and generalized threat to Donald Trump's life from
2:52:46
Iran yes I do believe it was director cheel is an Iranian assassin more
2:52:53
capable than a 20-year-old so I think we've acknowledged that there was gaps and a
2:52:59
failure that day we are when I raised this issue with director Ray he was incensed he he was shocked that the
2:53:06
threat assessment of Iran did not seem to be as we and I discussed baked in to
2:53:12
your security footprint and your threat assessment and he went on to say that the generalized threat that he has told
2:53:17
the whole country that we are under from a terrorist a potential terrorist threat he has said we're under the highest Threat Level
2:53:24
since 911 that the lights are flashing red and he has specifically indicated that people have crossed the southern
2:53:30
border as a result of the Biden administration's policy and that there are in our country today terrorists and
2:53:37
individuals who are affiliated with terrorist groups and organizations that would be a heightened threat environment
2:53:43
director Cheeto would it not yes in his public statements he has said he is making these statements
2:53:50
because he wants people to take them into consideration in threat assessments
2:53:55
specifically now that would be a threat not just to Donald Trump but it would also be a threat to the crowd there
2:54:01
wouldn't it yes are Isis terrorists and Al-Qaeda terrorists and international
2:54:08
groups in terrorists more capable than a 20-year-old in pulling off mass shooting
2:54:13
or an assassination of Donald Trump sir again there was clearly aak break down and a failure that day have
2:54:20
you read the intelligence of the terrorists that are currently in the United States that director Ray speaks
2:54:25
and those individuals that are here that are affiliated with terrorist groups and organizations that are in the process as director Bray said of representing a
2:54:33
significant threat of a terrorist attack occurring in the United States I have read reports that apply specifically to
2:54:40
the secret Services Mission director Cheeto because Donald
2:54:45
Trump is alive and thank God he is you look incompetent if Donald Trump had been killed you would have looked culpable there is no
2:54:53
aspect of this that indicates that there has been any protection to Donald Trump the threat was was identified before he
2:55:00
took sta the stage and the shooter was only killed after Donald Trump himself was killed not only should you resign if
2:55:07
you refuse to do so President Biden needs to fire you because his life
2:55:12
Donald Trump's life and all the other people which you protect are at risk because you have no concept of the aspect that the security footprint needs
2:55:20
to be correlated to the threat I you back chair now recognize Mr Lynch from
2:55:25
Massachusetts thank you Mr chairman uh director cheel there were multiple
2:55:30
security failures at the former president's rally in in Butler
2:55:35
Pennsylvania first of all there was a failure to isolate the podium
2:55:41
from exposure to direct fire do we know who M who made that
2:55:47
decision to to allow that rooftop to
2:55:53
remain as a an unprotected area do we know who came up with that security plan
2:55:58
that that uh omitted that sir I don't have uh a specific
2:56:05
person to identify for you okay well that's what I'm looking for so let's let's move on uh there's also a
2:56:10
breakdown in Security in Failure to confront the shooter uh over an hour
2:56:16
before the former president began his remark Mar s when the shooter was identified as a person of interest um
2:56:24
what particularly allowed agents or or law
2:56:29
enforcement to identify him as a person of interest so I appreciate the question
2:56:35
and again I will say that we are nine days out and there are multitude of interviews that are still taking place
2:56:40
okay so did he have a rangefinder there was some reports that that the individual had a rangefinder that would
2:56:47
that was certainly raised my suspicion uh did he have a rangefinder yes he did but may I explain
2:56:55
that at a number of our sites especially when you're at outdoor venues uh a rangefinder is not a prohibited item it
2:57:02
is sometimes an item that is brought in by individuals if you're going to be did anybody anybody confront him on that
2:57:08
anybody ask him questions what are you doing with the rangefinder anybody
2:57:13
confront him on on his presence where where he was in proximity to the Pres president so again to my knowledge I
2:57:20
believe that that was the process that was taking place was to locate the individual did they did they confront him did they go up to him did they talk
2:57:28
to him I do not have those details at this time those are important details
2:57:34
uh it was also a failure to communicate between law enforcement to act quickly
2:57:40
uh upon information provided by either local law enforcement or rally attendees
2:57:45
that the suspect was positioned on the rule there were minutes of delay uh
2:57:51
before um any any meaningful action was taken even though he was several hundred
2:57:56
feet from the podium and uh this was obviously minutes before the the shooting
2:58:04
um let me ask you there was considerable delay in removing the president uh from the podium after the
2:58:12
shooting began he got shot in the air it was still a over a minute before he was
2:58:18
removed from the stage meanwhile this Shooter had multiple clips several Clips
2:58:24
he got off eight shots and he had the capacity and the ability if he was not
2:58:31
neutralized to to basically mow down that whole Secret Service Detachment as
2:58:38
well as the president um what from your own
2:58:44
investigation uh caused that that delay and the circumstances what I can tell you is
2:58:51
that when the agents uh identified that the shooting was taking place in under
2:58:57
three seconds they threw themselves on top I understand that there was heroism
2:59:02
there no question about it no question about it but protocol would indicate and
2:59:07
these are you know these are uh the the the opinions of various former Secret
2:59:14
Service agents people who have uh done this work in the past that over a minute
2:59:19
of exposure on that Podium with with a a
2:59:24
shooter with a high capacity weapon who had already wounded the president and
2:59:30
and and could have got off we don't know how many more rounds um and yet the
2:59:37
president remained exposed even though he was joined in that exposure by the
2:59:42
Secret Service in their heroic acts it just uh it I don't know if there's a
2:59:49
good explanation for that our Personnel created a body bunker on top of the
2:59:54
president I get shielding him yeah this was this was an AR-15 uh style weapon
2:59:59
that would have made pretty quick work if he if he was determined and able to do so this is not the first
3:00:06
investigation that we've had of the Secret Service during my time here on this committee and the last one we had
3:00:11
uh our previous investigation determined that the Secret Service was experienced
3:00:16
a staffing crisis that poses perhaps the greatest threat to the agency and that's a quote is that Staffing crisis still in
3:00:25
place is that still something that you deal with on a daily basis as of today the secret service has just over 8,000
3:00:32
employees we continue to hire uh knowing that we need to ensure that we keep Pace
3:00:38
with what would be the full complement of of and get them times expired but please answer the question yeah I'm
3:00:45
sorry what would be the full compliment that you're looking for you've got 8,000 and how many how many would be a full
3:00:50
compliment for for the service so we are we are still striving towards a number of 95 uh 100 employees approximately in
3:00:59
order to be able to meet future and emerging needs okay thank you Mr chairman for your courtesy i y back
3:01:04
chair recognizes Dr Fox from North Carolina thank you Mr chairman director
3:01:09
cheel what grade would you give the secret Services performance in Butler Pennsylvania on July 13
3:01:19
as I've stated ma'am this was clearly a failure I would grade the agents and
3:01:25
officers who selflessly threw themselves in front of the president and neutralized the threat and a I think
3:01:32
that we need to examine the events that led up to uh and prior to that
3:01:39
day you stated in 2021 that the secret service has a zero fail Mission it's
3:01:45
clear that the events of July 13 show a Cascade of failures that cost Corey
3:01:51
comparator his life nearly cost former president his life and injured David
3:01:56
Dutch and James copenhaver when an agency fails spectacularly at its
3:02:02
Mission those responsible must be held accountable and the problems must be
3:02:07
fixed so they cannot happen again why should the American people or the officials you're responsible for
3:02:13
protecting have confidence in your ability to lead the Secret Service after
3:02:19
such a spectacular failure I appreciate the question and I am committed to
3:02:24
finding answers so that we can make the agency stronger after this you said on
3:02:29
July 15 that the buck stops with me how are you taking accountability for the
3:02:35
secret Services failures during the July 13 assassination attempt on President
3:02:40
Trump I have taken accountability and I will continue to take accountability I am responsible for leading the agency
3:02:47
and I am responsible for finding the answers to how this event occurred and making sure that it doesn't happen again
3:02:55
so I would like to explore how you got the job as director of the United States
3:03:01
Secret Service is it typical for the director of The Secret Service to be recommended
3:03:07
for the role at the behest of a president's family and Senior staff perhaps at the request of Joe Biden or
3:03:14
Anthony Bernal got the job as a director of The Secret Service because I spent 27 years
3:03:22
in an agency with a mission that I absolutely love I started my career in Detroit I worked my way up through
3:03:29
investigations and protection were you was there competition for the
3:03:35
position you would have to ask those who were involved in the interview
3:03:40
process uh but you think you are the best person in the country to head the
3:03:45
Secret Service I think that I am the best person to lead the secret service at this
3:03:51
time the Secret Service receives billions in funding each year as has been explained by my colleagues here in
3:03:59
fact the incre you've had an increase in real terms of
3:04:05
55% as you're no doubt aware Staffing levels for those assigned to protect the
3:04:11
president former presidents and other senior officials has decreased by about
3:04:16
350 50 between 2014 and today clearly a lack of Financial Resources not to blame
3:04:24
for the staffing shortage in 2022 the Secret Service saw nearly half
3:04:30
its Workforce leave in one year and during the same year it was ranked dead last among law enforcement agencies in
3:04:37
the best places to work in the federal government can you explain why your agency was so poorly rated and why so
3:04:43
many staff left in just one year so with all due respect I uh dispute the
3:04:51
the statistic of half of the employees leaving uh in 2022 I think that that has been inaccurate data that's been
3:04:58
reported out there but what I can tell you is as I have returned as the Director of the agency we have had an
3:05:03
increase in hiring and Staffing and an increase in resources and we are committed to continue to hire uh so that
3:05:11
we can be staffed appropriately to meet the dynamic mission that we have well
3:05:18
uh you may want to dispute it but it's out there my understand given the
3:05:23
high-profile high profile failures and rotten culture at the Secret Service
3:05:29
during your nearly two-year turn tenure why should the American people have any
3:05:34
confidence in your ability to lead the Secret Service to perform its zero fail
3:05:40
mission to protect our senior leaders the secret service has an incredible culture our men and women
3:05:47
Place service over self they come in every day willing to risk their lives
3:05:52
for our protective Mission and they work investigations that uh thwart people who
3:05:58
would do harm to children uh child exploiters we have an incredible Mission and our culture is we will get the job
3:06:05
done no matter what well those on the front lines certainly have a great culture and they were willing to risk
3:06:11
their lives for president Trump but I'm not sure the leadership at the agency
3:06:17
has this right kind of culture I yield back Mr chairman chair now recognize Mr Conley from Virginia thank you Mr
3:06:24
chairman well I hope the American people do appreciate the incredible daily risks
3:06:33
Secret Service agents take on our behalf you mentioned there are 36 regular
3:06:40
client you've got that you protect constantly but I was participating in
3:06:45
the NATO Summit just two weeks ago we had 32 heads of government and heads of state plus visiting heads of state and
3:06:52
heads of government presumably you provided protection for all of them that is correct just just saying
3:07:00
um help us understand however I I I I will stipulate that there there's an
3:07:06
ongoing investigation you don't want to go into too much detail on that until you've been able to ascertain all the
3:07:12
facts and analyze what they mean you can understand however the anxiety we and
3:07:18
the American public have about how could this happen and how can we ensure it can't
3:07:26
recur now there are some things my friends uh uh on one particular side of
3:07:32
the aisle don't really want to talk about like AR-15s and access to them by
3:07:38
a 20-year-old or anybody for that matter presumably uh director cheel the
3:07:45
ubiquity of weap weapons guns in America especially assault weapons or
3:07:51
semi-automatic weapons that's helped your job and the mission of your agencies right it's it's made it less
3:07:58
complicated isn't that true I'm sorry I'm not understanding your question real simple more guns
3:08:05
especially Dangerous Ones have made your job protecting people easier is that not
3:08:12
right I think at uh from every director cheetah this is simple English more guns
3:08:20
are do they make your job more complicated or less complicated in protecting these 36 clients and visiting
3:08:28
heads of state and heads of government that come to Washington I think the Secret Service needs to take into
3:08:33
account I didn't ask that I'm I'm sorry I asked a simple question which deserves
3:08:39
a simple answer the iquity of guns dangerous weapons in America like
3:08:46
AR-15s has that made your job that is to say the mission of the Secret Service easier or more difficult I think the
3:08:53
threat environment for protecting our uh Secret Service uh protect e is always
3:08:59
difficult and that's Dynamic and it's always evolving we stipulate it's always difficult I again this is a simple
3:09:09
one do does the ibiquity of guns make your job easier or more difficult
3:09:15
today I understand the second amendment rights of individuals I didn't ask that question I'm not questioning the Second
3:09:21
Amendment I'm asking a simple analysis director cheel and I can tell you you're
3:09:27
not making my job easier in terms of assessing your qualification for
3:09:33
continuing on as director please answer the question you're the head of the Secret Service
3:09:39
you're speaking on behalf of 8,000 members who put their lives on the line we just had a failure by your own
3:09:45
admission to guns make your job easier or harder I think the job of the Secret
3:09:51
Service is difficult on every day and we need to make sure that we are mitigating all threats whether that be that isn't
3:09:59
my question that is not my question and now I think you're evading the answer
3:10:05
which is not a hard one I am sorry that you feel that way sir H how else could I feel director
3:10:11
cheetle when you're clearly avoiding a direct answer to a very simple declarative question
3:10:18
we almost lost a presidential candidate the other day a 20-year-old had access
3:10:25
to his father's AR-15 and got on top of a roof within 500 yards or feet of the
3:10:32
podium and I'm asking you did the availability of that AR-15 which is
3:10:38
replicated all across America make your job harder or easier and you're not willing to answer that question and you
3:10:45
think and and you wonder why we might have a lack of confidence in your continued ability to direct this agency
3:10:52
I understand your question and that's the environment well if you understand my question why not answer it because
3:10:57
it's the environment that the Secret Service Works in every day that that doesn't tell me anything
3:11:04
that's the that's the environment we work in I had an I had an attack on my office
3:11:11
a year ago I know a little bit about violence too he came to kill me
3:11:18
when he couldn't he beat one of my staffers eight times with a baseball bat
3:11:23
on the head we live with the threat of violence but a simple answer from the
3:11:29
director of The Secret Service would be helpful and I'm sorry you've chosen to evade it I yeld back chair now recognize
3:11:36
Mr grofman from Wisconsin thank you um when this guy uh
3:11:45
took the shots he climbed a lad to get on the roof correct I'm unable to answer details of
3:11:51
exactly how the individual access the roof at this time do you know when the uh if he did
3:11:59
use the ladder do you know when the ladder was placed there was the ladder there two days before just the night
3:12:05
before do you have any information at all as to when the L ladder got there I would like to be able to answer those
3:12:10
questions the FBI is still conducting an investigation how did the rifle get to
3:12:16
the to the roof again sir at this time un unable to answer questions to provide have they
3:12:23
cleaned the roof since the since the assassination
3:12:28
attempt have they cleaned the roof right has anything been done to the roof is it just like it was you know whatever 10
3:12:35
days ago or or or not has anything been done to the roof I I don't have an answer for
3:12:43
that okay um were president Trump's normal agents normally assigned to him
3:12:49
there that day yes there was no these were the same
3:12:55
agents that were always there yes sir the people that are assigned to his detail were working on
3:13:02
that day okay there there's stuff on the internet that says they were not there that day but these are the same agents
3:13:08
who are routinely there yes sir okay uh do we know which agents fired
3:13:15
the shots that finally took down the potential assassin yes sir I do can you give us
3:13:22
those names or background of those agents I would not uh offer their name
3:13:27
up in this setting but it was one of our technical uh officers or counter snipers
3:13:33
okay so can we privately get those names the committee I I am certain that we can
3:13:39
make names available privately okay um do we know where all the shots
3:13:45
landed how for of all how many shots did did the potential assassin how many shots uh came out of the rifle so again
3:13:53
I would hesitate to offer that information as the FBI is conducting an
3:13:59
investigation have we got the bullets from all the shots again that would be the responsibility of the FBI to collect
3:14:05
that evidence okay um do we have
3:14:12
any do we have the correspondence um from the shooter has that been recovered
3:14:20
from his phone whatever again I would have to defer you to the FBI for details on that
3:14:27
investigation okay um you spent some time uh trying to
3:14:35
change the makeup of the Secret Service okay you feel there whatever too high a
3:14:40
percentage our men um does this affect at all uh who you
3:14:48
are hiring for the Secret Service I've spent my time as the Director trying to increase the number
3:14:55
of people that we hire in the Secret Service so that we have the best and the brightest and that's been my
3:15:01
concentration as the Director okay you ever hiring uh
3:15:08
hiring not hiring men because of your desire to hit certain targets I am hiring the best qualified
3:15:16
candidates that put in an application that want to work for our great
3:15:21
organization okay um next next question uh the shooter
3:15:30
obtained a direct sight of of President Trump from from uh the position on the
3:15:36
rooftop I assume that is not something that should ever happen it should never happen do you want to elaborate a little
3:15:42
on how that happened or what you wish you had done differently or would do differently next then there's a trump
3:15:48
rally again sir the facts of this uh particular event are still unfolding uh
3:15:55
nine days there have been a number of reports that have been out there so I do not want to provide an inform
3:16:01
information that perhaps would contradict something that has been erroneously reported or uh is not
3:16:07
factual but there clearly was a mistake and we will take every effort to make sure that this never happens again could
3:16:15
you elaborate why you want one3 the uh uh Secret Service to be
3:16:21
women I've never stated that I want onethird of the Secret Service to be women 30% or something you had some
3:16:27
Target no um okay j y sure I'll Y what was
3:16:35
director what was erroneously reported you said to Mr Gran's question you said something was erroneously reported what
3:16:40
are you referring to I'm referring to his question was in in the context of the shooter using a ladder to get on the
3:16:46
building what was erroneously reported because you won't tell us anything but you'll tell us something that wasn't reported accurately I'm saying sir that
3:16:53
there have been a number of reports that are out there that have been speculation and until we have the actual facts I
3:17:00
don't want to report anything that would contradict uh speculation that has been out there thank gentleman fer chair
3:17:08
recognize Mr Chris morte from Illinois thank you Mr chair thank you Mr ranking member for bringing us together
3:17:15
this morning one question I get asked a lot from my constituents is what can Congress actually do to stop this from
3:17:21
happening again and I'd like to share a graphic from a very recent study conducted by Professor Robert Pape a
3:17:28
world-renowned expert in combating political violence the graphic shows that 74% of Americans want this Congress
3:17:36
to come together to denounce political violence of all stripes and you can tell it's across party
3:17:42
lines um I commend the chair and ranking member for putting out the statement the other day condemning political violence
3:17:49
and to further this effort um I'd like to ask all my colleagues to join Dr Brad wstr and me in introducing a resolution
3:17:57
that we think can secure unanimous house passage in deploring and condemning political violence and we will be
3:18:04
circulating that resolution shortly director cheel as you know the
3:18:11
shooter began shooting at 6:11 p.m. Eastern on July 13th and reported that
3:18:17
at 5:51 p.m. 20 minutes before the shooting began the state police informed
3:18:22
the Secret Service of their concern now the rally was not paused at that point correct no and according to NBC just two
3:18:31
minutes later at 553 p.m. the Secret Service notified its snipers about the
3:18:38
gunman the rally wasn't paused at that point either correct no let me show you some video
3:18:45
footage by rally go if you could play the video on the screen up
3:18:53
here this was taken 2 minutes before the shooting start if you could turn up the
3:19:02
volume on the roof we have people right on the
3:19:11
roof Ro ma'am that doesn't look like suspicious beh behavior that looks like
3:19:17
threatening behavior to me and the rally wasn't paused at that point either correct I can tell you as I stated
3:19:24
earlier sir that the moment that the shift uh surrounding the president were
3:19:29
aware of an actual threat that's a threat right there the guy's on the roof
3:19:35
and everybody's yelling at him yes and and directing the officer attention to him the rally was not pause at that
3:19:41
point correct we are currently still combing through Communications and when
3:19:46
Communications were passed well I can point you to this communication it's two minutes before the shots started ringing
3:19:52
Out director cheel yes or no was there ever a moment where the Secret Service
3:19:57
actually considered pausing the rally the Secret Service would have paused the rally had they known or been
3:20:05
told so the answer is no an actual threat the answer is no
3:20:10
correct I can I can speak to you in generalities no no I don't want generalities I want specific
3:20:17
the answer is no you did not consider pausing the rally correct the people that are in charge of protecting the
3:20:23
president on that day would never bring the former president out if there was a
3:20:28
threat that had been identified well they did because we've now identified three points in the in the 20 minutes
3:20:35
before the shooting that the threat emerged let me point you to something else uh which is the building that the
3:20:43
shooter was perched on seen here this building is called the AGR building I'm
3:20:48
sure that you're familiar with it um it's no more than 150 yards from the stage where Donald Trump stood yet the
3:20:55
security perimeter was drawn such that the AGR building was placed outside of IT director cheel according to the
3:21:02
Washington Post the AR AR-15 styled rifle used in the shooting had had a
3:21:07
range of 400 to 600 yards and therefore the AGR building is was clearly within
3:21:14
rifle range of the stage correct yes NBC News has reported that
3:21:20
in the days before the rally the Secret Service had identified the building as a vulnerability that required special
3:21:26
attention correct that's reporting from NBC yes so
3:21:32
I am still looking into an active investigation I know but it's been nine days I mean you you should you should
3:21:38
know that right and yet despite the fact that the AGR building was in rifle range
3:21:43
of the stage and it was flagged as a vulnerability this building was put outside of the secret Services security
3:21:50
perimeter and I I I respectfully submit the security Secret Service must expand
3:21:55
its security perimeter to account for the kinds of weapons that can be used outside the perimeter to endanger the
3:22:03
protectees inside the perimeter ma'am let me turn your attention to some
3:22:08
conspiracy theories that have been uh circulating and ask you to uh comment on them first you have not
3:22:16
found evidence that the incident was a stage shooting right correct and you haven't found evidence that this was a
3:22:22
result of a conspiracy of high ranking government officials correct correct and you have not found evidence that this
3:22:28
incident was in fact directed or perpetrated by a foreign state or entity right and that's the last question but
3:22:34
I'll let the director answer that please not at this time thank you I yield back gentleman's times expired chair I
3:22:39
recognize Mr cloud from Texas uh thank you I just wanted to confirm there was only one counter sniper who took one
3:22:46
shot is that we had multiple counter sniper teams available yeah on the premises but
3:22:53
is only one took one shot is that correct or only one correct okay um how many spent shell casings were found on
3:23:00
the roof again I would have to defer you to the FBI's criminal investigation okay
3:23:05
word is is that the car was ruged with explosives again sir I'd have to defer you to the FBI's
3:23:12
investigation okay you're you're not curious about you communicate with
3:23:18
them no okay uh CNN reported that the Secret Service did not sweep the
3:23:23
building the shooter was used to shoot president Trump and other attendees is that true or false so we are conducting
3:23:31
a mission Insurance investigation and will depend on the information that we obtain from our investigations okay um
3:23:38
secret service knew there was a suspicious person anywhere from 8 minutes before President walked on stage to 30 to 60 minutes we have different
3:23:46
reports reps was President Trump or his team notified of the threat I think there's a difference and
3:23:52
a distinction between suspicious suspicious person and threat yeah so uh we are going back and looking at
3:23:58
communications to know when the information about a suspicious person was passed to Secret Service
3:24:06
Personnel okay but was President Trump or his team notified again we are going
3:24:11
back and looking to make sure that we have the exact information of when those notifications were made and who those
3:24:17
notifications were made to okay it I think it's trembling for a lot of us that the number one question everyone in
3:24:23
America is wondering is why was the roof left open and after 9 days we should at least maybe have a little bit of that
3:24:30
information and when you come to this Committee hearing and you don't have anything to say about that it's it's
3:24:37
very very troubling um did you review the security plan for this event I personally do not review
3:24:44
security plans for Ev events that take place across the
3:24:50
country any of them we have a number of events who's
3:24:55
the top level official who re reviews the security plans there there's a number of people that review security
3:25:01
plans who timely responsible for signing off on a security plan it it's a
3:25:06
conjunction of personnel uh there are people on the ground there are supervisors on the detail there are people at headquarters so there's not
3:25:13
one person who says okay this is good we're it's copesthetic we're going for it I think much in the way that we build
3:25:20
our security plans where they are multi teams working different aspects of it but ultimately isn't there an individual
3:25:26
who signs off on the plan much like how we design our security plans they're multi-layered there are multiple layers
3:25:33
so there's no accountability there is accountability sir there's this is this
3:25:38
is whe whether it's the FBI or fouchy or any It's Time After Time After Time
3:25:44
these multiple layers of accountability turned into layers of plausible deniability in agency after agency after
3:25:52
agency that's got to be fixed because you keep coming here and expecting yes you're saying I'm responsible but and
3:25:59
you're accountable for it but then there's no there's nothing what do you mean by that I mean you're you're saying
3:26:04
you're going to keep your job right I assure you sir that if we determine through the course of our
3:26:11
investigation that someone or people need to be held accountable we will do
3:26:17
so what level of if President Biden God forbid had been shot and killed would
3:26:25
you think that was worthy of resignation I would do the same thing that I'm doing here where I would want
3:26:31
to make sure that we are conducting an investigation that there is continuity
3:26:36
in that investigation and that we could find the answers to what Happ assassination of somebody under your DET
3:26:42
under your details worthy of resignation I think that this event was tragic and deserves
3:26:47
answers the thing that you've said so far is that you want to make sure that this never happens again the thing is
3:26:53
everyone in America knows that's not the job description that you're tasked with the job description you're tasked with is to make sure it never happens period
3:27:01
um one of your goals in the Strategic plan is to Champion diversity Equity
3:27:07
inclusion and accessibility you've accomplished the accessibility part
3:27:13
um what standards do you keep the same same standards for all applicants and
3:27:19
all does every secret service agent meet the same qualifications or do you have different standards for different people
3:27:25
yes sir everyone who moves through the application process has to meet the same standards to become a special
3:27:32
agent okay the the trouble I think we're having with right now so far you gave a
3:27:37
lame excuse for sloped roof you said that local law enforcement's job was to
3:27:42
cover up the uh building before back tring on that we were told that
3:27:48
President Trump's team did not ask for security before you backtracked on that you haven't provided the audio recording
3:27:53
that this committee the chairman s uh requested that was due Thursday um you
3:28:00
didn't give us Advanced copy of your opening statement but yet there was reporting on it somewhere else uh there
3:28:06
seems to be more information from YouTube videos than you're able to provide for us and it it begs the
3:28:11
question to anyone you're in charge of the investigation of your own failure so how is anybody in America supposed to be
3:28:18
able to trust the results of that investigation as being anything transparent and genuine that's
3:28:26
the last question but please feel free to answer the question director sir I've been a secret service agent for nearly 30 years I have led with integrity and I
3:28:34
follow our core values of Duty Justice honor loyalty and courage and I am doing
3:28:41
that in this case and I assure this committee that I will provide answers with we have a full and complete report
3:28:48
in addition to cooperating with all of the other investigations that are ongoing chair now recognize Mr Conor
3:28:55
from California thank you Mr chair I want to thank the chair and the ranking member for convening this hearing on a
3:29:02
bipartisan basis I joined them in condemning the horrific assassination
3:29:09
attempt on the former president I am relieved for the sake of the country
3:29:14
that he wasn't serious ly hurt and that he survived and my thoughts with him and
3:29:20
his family during such a traumatic event I also want to express condolences to
3:29:25
Corey comor family and uh recognize his
3:29:31
heroism in Saving his uh daughters lives and to the victims of that awful event
3:29:39
now director K would you agree that this is the most serious security lapse since
3:29:46
President Reagan was shot in 1981 of the Secret Service yes sir I would and you
3:29:52
know do you know what Stuart Knight did when he was in charge at the time of the Secret Service you know what he did
3:30:00
afterwards he remained on duty he resigned he resigned and Stuart Knight
3:30:06
was not a Democratic appointee or a republican appointee look I'm not
3:30:11
questioning your judgment I and I just don't think this is partisan if you have an assassination attempt on a president
3:30:19
a former president or uh a candidate you need to resign that's what Stuart Knight
3:30:25
did he was a Republican appointee and he took responsibility and I I think you
3:30:31
need to reflect this is not a question of you it's a question of the American people you cannot go leading a Secret
3:30:37
Service Agency when there is an assassination attempt on a presidential
3:30:44
candidate I would I would say that about anyone who uh is running and so I guess
3:30:50
my question to you is what's the difference between your position and what Stewart Knight
3:30:57
did what I will tell you sir is that I am dedicated to finding the answers to what happened and like every secret
3:31:04
service agent we don't Sherk our responsibilities I will remain on and be
3:31:09
responsible to the agency to this committee to the former president and to the American public but is is there a
3:31:15
reason you wouldn't just do what stord Knight did after the Reagan assassination attempt I believe
3:31:22
that I provided an answer there's there's nothing more that you have to say I mean do you really
3:31:27
believe at this moment given how divided the country is and the questions asked that your service in this role is the
3:31:35
best for the nation I mean I I'm not saying you can't do public service again you can't do something else again do you really genuinely in your heart believe
3:31:41
that you being in this role is what's right for America at this moment you do you think there are people who are Trump
3:31:48
supporters who have confidence in you the one thing that the we've got to have agencies in this country that are
3:31:53
transcend politics that have the confidence of Independents Democrats Republicans progressives conservatives
3:32:00
do you really believe that the majority of this country has confidence in you right now I believe that the country
3:32:05
deserves answers and I am committed to finding those answers and providing those answers well I well look I believe
3:32:13
director shidel that you should resign I think there are colleagues on both sides of the aisle who believe that and I hope
3:32:18
you'll consider it he y
3:32:24
back chair now recognizes uh Mr Palmer
3:32:29
from Alabama for five minutes director Tel did local law enforcement uh ESU
3:32:34
teams have compromised authority to engage a perceived
3:32:40
threat yes uh why do you think they didn't use it I believe that that they
3:32:46
follow the same use of force uh that our you don't when you have compromised Authority you don't have to get
3:32:52
permission if you perceive a threat and there were U not just the ESU units but
3:32:59
there were local law enforcement that had line of sight on the shooter before the shots were taken so one of my uh
3:33:07
questions is is there was supposed to be a briefing with the uh Secret Service sniper units your counter assault team
3:33:15
member MERS with the contract team with the local ESU teams that didn't take
3:33:22
place why was that so I have been told that there has been a briefing there was a briefing that took place I've been
3:33:28
told that there wasn't one and again we are still looking into the facts of the investigation so let me ask you this uh
3:33:37
when were you informed that there was a credible threat against uh president Trump former president Trump when did
3:33:44
you learn of that sir the former president has a number of threats I I I didn't ask you that there was a credible
3:33:49
threat from Iran when were you informed of that answer the question we have been
3:33:55
monitoring the threats you for the before you knew before the rally okay
3:34:01
all right uh the site security plan is generally drafted by uh the site
3:34:09
supervisor in the site agent uh probably out of the Pittsburgh district office
3:34:16
uh did they take into account the credible threat against President trump our Personnel take into account the
3:34:22
threats that are why would they leave a building and I will correct the distance that's been quoted it was about 140
3:34:28
yards with clear line of sight to the president why was that building not occupied on the roof I mean you could
3:34:34
have put Barney F on the roof and and kept somebody from getting up there so why why wasn't that
3:34:41
done the plan that was developed that day encompassed a number of security
3:34:47
mitigations the the the issue is the site supervisor the site agent and and
3:34:53
the and the special agent in charge who Pro I think signed off on the plan did
3:34:59
not include that in the in the interner perimeter and they didn't have a plan to secure the building the as I understand
3:35:07
it the Butler County ESU unit was situated on the second floor of a of a
3:35:12
building next to that but they didn't have a clear line of sight of the RO roof the angle was too
3:35:17
severe uh the photograph that was taken of the young man uh of the shooter when
3:35:23
he had the rangefinder was taken at 5:15 it wasn't until 538 that that photograph
3:35:29
was uh transmitted to the Secret Service sniper units I don't understand the lack
3:35:35
of interoperability here in the communication process I don't understand why uh people didn't perceive that as a
3:35:41
credible threat uh the video that Mr Christen morphe had shown there was clearly a credible
3:35:48
threat so how is it that all of these mistakes could be made how many
3:35:54
explosive devices were found on or near the site again I would have to defer you to
3:36:00
the FBI Madam I I believe they were in his car and and there I think there
3:36:06
might have been one near a main gas line uh it wasn't just the fact that he
3:36:11
had a rifle it was the fact that he had the ability to inflict enormous harm
3:36:18
enormous numbers of casualties had those devices exploded
3:36:24
um I want to know also um when you when your agents
3:36:32
conduct a site review are they fully informed of all of the threats that are being made against
3:36:40
uh the the the principle that they're protecting
3:36:46
what I can tell you is that when our agents go out to conduct an advance their whole goal is to ensure the goal
3:36:53
is the the failure to secure that building not only put the president former president's life in danger it put
3:36:59
the the lives of individuals in the crowd in danger as well I mean the Reagan shooting there were other people
3:37:05
shot at that time as well uh and the Secret Service members
3:37:11
lives were in danger so I don't don't understand how you can continue to stay
3:37:19
in the position you're in when this was a a a failure of historic
3:37:29
magnitude 43 years without anything like this happening and and you failed in
3:37:35
this case in a spectacular way Mr chairman y back gentleman yields back
3:37:40
chair recognizes Mr infu from Maryland thank you Mr chair I want to
3:37:46
commend you and the uh ranking member on your joint statement and for holding this hearing that we might all at least
3:37:52
attempt to try to get some answers some of us uh Miss cheel grew up in an era uh
3:37:59
not too unlike what we see today in terms of political violence and some of us remember the November 22nd 1963
3:38:08
assassination of President Kennedy uh some of us like myself remember two days
3:38:14
later when Jack Ruby on live TV shot and killed Lee Harvey Oswald we've seen over
3:38:21
and over and over since that time these kind of attempts whether it was the assassination of Martin Luther King or
3:38:27
Bobby Kennedy or the attempted attack on George Wallace and Laurel Maryland the
3:38:32
shooting in 1981 of Ronald Reagan our friend and colleague Steve siss shooting
3:38:38
here in DC and the unfortunate attack on Paul Pelosi and now this matter
3:38:44
regarding former president Trump I I'm let me try if I might to
3:38:51
take another walk at this people just assume
3:38:57
that whoever is in charge takes full responsibility when there's never been
3:39:02
at least on this magnitude and scale this sort of failure so when members ask
3:39:08
you are you going to resign and you say you have no intention to they are
3:39:15
like many people who watch what's going on and I there's some things I just
3:39:21
don't understand why was the building the ARG building placed outside of the
3:39:27
perimeter when clearly it was close enough for someone to launch an
3:39:33
attack so again sir we are looking into all of the details of how the advanced was comprised but I can tell you that
3:39:39
there was OverWatch on that building provided that day by a drone
3:39:45
I'm not going to get into the specifics of technology or assets that were used in well I think this fair to say the
3:39:51
OverWatch failed because the shooter got up on the roof and stayed there for a while and people had pointed him out so
3:39:57
do you think that your OverWatch was a failure in that case I think that we need to know the full details to
3:40:04
understand how this occurred and why was the rooftop left naked to begin with can
3:40:09
you tell us that considering it was within the line of sight and so very close
3:40:16
again I I can't speak to the specifics of this particular event site but what I
3:40:22
can tell you is that when the Secret Service develops an advanced plan they take into account a number of uh factors
3:40:29
when they're when they're building their Advance uh if there are buildings or areas of concern and OverWatch is uh one
3:40:37
of those mitigations that they want to put in place then they will cover off areas of
3:40:43
responsibility I understand that but the shooter came to the attention of your agency 52 minutes before the former
3:40:50
president got to the stage did anybody get assigned to watch or cover that
3:40:55
individual who had already been seen with a uh Advanced finder on him and
3:41:02
other suspicious matters was anybody assigned to track him so what I'd like to clarify is that a suspicious
3:41:09
individual I got that part A thre to the attention I know of our personnel and
3:41:15
again having a rangefinder at an outdoor event well let me ask you this when the
3:41:20
suspicious person was brought to the attention of the Secret Service was anybody in the detail order to follow
3:41:28
and stay with that suspicious person just because they might become a threat
3:41:33
so we have a number of teams that are on the ground uh and again we are trying to verify the timelines of when those
3:41:39
notifications were made to our Personnel so that they could uh assume the responsibility of trying to track that
3:41:45
individual Miss Cheeto there has been uh a lot of discussion some of which raised
3:41:51
itself earlier in this hearing about poor staff morale within your agency and
3:41:58
I have the July 17th report of uh government executive which is a credible
3:42:04
reporting service for the federal government for employees and the 2023
3:42:10
ranking of places to work within the federal government shows and this is through the office of personnel
3:42:17
management that the Secret Service came in 413th out of 459 sub agencies and
3:42:25
agencies can you explain that certainly what I can tell you is
3:42:30
the Secret Service is a difficult job it challenges our employees daily it's
3:42:36
holidays it's weekends it's no leave periods but but but Madam people come to
3:42:43
work knowing that you do explain that when you hire somebody they know that
3:42:48
it's the same with other agencies they they miss holidays they come to work at odd hours but to be wor one of the worst
3:42:56
places to work within the federal government 413 out of
3:43:02
459 I'm I just need an explanation what do you think as the Director there I
3:43:07
think that this and that's the last question but please answer Mr U's question I think that this is a challenging job I think that it's a
3:43:13
challenging environment to be in law enforcement and we do have a no fail Mission and our folks are tasked with
3:43:19
that every day 365 days of the year but I can tell you I've also taken a number of measures since I've been the director
3:43:27
to recruit and retain and stem the tide of attrition in our agency which will
3:43:32
hopefully alleviate some of that thank you Mr chairman uh chair now recognize Mr sessions from Texas Mr chairman thank
3:43:39
you very much I join in the the calls of both all of our members to say thank you for doing this hearing on a bipartisan
3:43:48
basis director I'm not going to sit here and say you ought to resign but I am going to say that you have not given us
3:43:55
confidence that you have the ability to understand what happened to take the
3:44:02
responsibility in terms of understanding you've spent a number of years how many
3:44:07
years do you say you've been with the agency 29 well I spent 16 years with
3:44:13
AT&T move 7 times with them and had a really good feel about their operations
3:44:20
how they worked what was acceptable who was responsible and I've heard you say
3:44:25
today numbers of times well you've got to wait well you've got to wait wait for
3:44:30
the final report when is the final final going to
3:44:36
happen I am me how long do we have to wait before you can give us credible
3:44:41
answers you've been there 28 years you've had a few days to be able to draw your own analysis of this you should
3:44:50
understand the entire process you talked about being on the team perhaps in Georgia you have talked about your uh
3:44:57
experience in this you've talked about the professional nature of the agency that I don't doubt but the director just
3:45:04
like it was when I ran my operations at AT&T was responsible for making sure
3:45:10
they worked and in business either works or it doesn't work work there's no in
3:45:16
between it either works or it does not work and your job as the in essence
3:45:21
administrator the director is to make sure it looks right and works and I've
3:45:26
not heard you say one thing about my analysis is I have asked these questions
3:45:32
it's always I've got to sit back and wait for someone else to decide that so I'm going to ask you a question that
3:45:38
maybe you can answer have any employees been disciplined for their role in
3:45:45
Butler PA incident no sir not at this time I am
3:45:50
asking those questions so no employee has been disciplined and no employee has
3:45:56
been uh placed in any position that would Place their job in Jeopardy nor
3:46:02
they standing in the agency we are still in the process of intervie that's not what I asked I I you're the person that
3:46:09
runs the place you're the person that knows right from wrong good from bad you've had a a number of days and now
3:46:16
you come before this committee knowing you're going to be before us and you've got to Slough it off to someone else do
3:46:24
you see where there was something that went wrong as a professional at agency
3:46:30
with 28 years or do you have to count on someone else to give you the final
3:46:35
report I see that something went wrong and I've acknowledge that something went wrong then what went wrong was the
3:46:41
special agent in charge not doing their job was the shooter not g was the shooter
3:46:47
giving extra time was the sniper doing their job I mean these are things that
3:46:53
people who've been around for 28 years can analyze quickly I watched it live on
3:46:59
TV and then within minutes saw a number of facts and factors that would have and
3:47:06
should have been known by people who were there you've got 28 years you're showing up here telling us and the
3:47:13
American public well I've got to wait for the final answer what is your evaluation I'm asking those same
3:47:20
questions well no you're you're before the committee tell us what went wrong a
3:47:25
special agent in charge the person who was there tell us and don't try and play
3:47:30
a shell came with us do you have the ability to effectively as the Director
3:47:37
of this agency to understand what went wrong and at least tell us uh I do or
3:47:43
don't know what I'm doing And We Come Away with and I'm not asking for you to resign I'm asking for you if you've got
3:47:51
this experience then you should be able to say to us we know what we did wrong
3:47:57
it was a failure in our system and we're immediately making these Corrections
3:48:02
that's why you're having a difficult time with this group of members of Congress because we saw it too we've
3:48:10
seen the things but you are the 28-year expert you the person that and only you
3:48:17
that can make the changes and I hear you say well I've got to wait for a final report before I at 28 years experience
3:48:25
that is why we think what you're doing the answers you're giving us are not
3:48:31
correct and you are not using your pro professional expertise Mr chairman I
3:48:37
will allow her to respond I am asking those same questions
3:48:42
sir and I assure you when I have a full full and complete uh report of exactly
3:48:48
what happened there will be accountability and we will make changes before I recognize the question
3:48:56
just out of curiosity director it's been Nine Days Every American once these
3:49:01
questions answered do you have a ballpark estimate of when what Mr sessions asked you would be able to
3:49:09
answer so I can tell I can tell you on our mission Assurance uh internal
3:49:14
investig vation we are targeting to have that completed uh within 60 days there's
3:49:19
also an external investigation that is going to be taking place there are a number of office of Inspector General
3:49:25
investigations as well and we are working in concert and then of course there's the Department of Justice FBI
3:49:31
criminal investigation chair chair recognize is Miss acasio Cortez from New York thank you uh Mr chairman um
3:49:39
director cheel respectfully what you had just laid out about 60 days uh we are currently in the
3:49:46
midst of a uh of of an
3:49:51
especially concentrated presidential campaign in the moment uh that is also
3:49:57
paired with of course elections happening across the country that are happening in about a 100 days so the
3:50:04
notion of a report coming out in 60 days when the threat environment is so high
3:50:10
in the United States irrespective of party is not acceptable and I think it's
3:50:15
very important to understand that this is not theater this is not about jockeying this is about the safety of
3:50:22
some of the most highly targeted and valued targets
3:50:28
internationally and domestically in the United States of America so the idea
3:50:33
that a report will be finalized in 60 days let alone prior to any
3:50:38
actionable uh decisions that would be made is simply not acceptable it has
3:50:46
been 10 days since an assassination attempt on a former president of the United States regardless of
3:50:51
party there need to be answers again this party this this this committee this is not a moment of
3:50:58
theater we have to make policy decisions and we have to make them now we do and
3:51:03
that may be a a and that may require legislation that may require policy that
3:51:09
we must pass in the immediate uh uh term and without that
3:51:15
we are Flying Blind so the lack of answers and the lack of report is just simply not something that we can accept
3:51:22
here um director cheel is there a standard perimeter that the Secret
3:51:27
Service establishes around an event or are those perimeters independently
3:51:32
determined per event and scenario there is no standard uh every event and every
3:51:37
ven venue is different and treated as such so they so each event has a
3:51:43
different uh perimeter that is established depending on on the logistics of that event now you
3:51:50
established earlier that the building upon which the shooter uh operated from
3:51:56
was outside of that established perimeter correct for the Butler Pennsylvania event it was outside of our
3:52:02
secure perimeter yes now that um that building was I believe 500 how far away
3:52:10
was that building from from the president uh it was approximately 200 yards 200 yards
3:52:18
now the individual uh used an
3:52:23
AR-15 in order to uh act out his assassination attempt an AR-15 has a
3:52:31
range of about 4 to 600 yards my question is why does the Secret Service
3:52:39
perimeter um why is the Secret Service protective perimeter shorter than one of the most
3:52:46
popular semi-automatic weapons in the United States there are a number of weapons out
3:52:53
there uh with a number of ranges uh again an advance was completed uh the
3:52:59
determination of the perimeter I'm not going to speak to specifics but there are a number of factors that are taken
3:53:04
into account when we determine our perimeter uh some of it has to do with terrain some of it has to do with building some of it has to do with
3:53:11
assets and resources uh that are available and so so what I'm what I'm
3:53:16
hearing is that a perimeter was not established outdoors in an outdoor venue
3:53:23
that would prevent an AR-15 which is one of the most common weapons used in mass
3:53:28
shootings um from being able to to be within the range of Secret Service
3:53:33
protection a perimeter was established and even though there were buildings that were outside of that perimeter it
3:53:40
wasn't just that building there were a number of buildings in the area uh and there was OverWatch that was created to
3:53:47
help mitigate some of those buildings um respectfully Dr cheel as
3:53:52
well um as a person who has experienced an enormous amount of threat
3:53:59
incidents including incidents that have never been reported publicly
3:54:05
um what there's a there is a common pattern that happens here whether it's
3:54:11
Secret Service FBI Capital police local Department ments after a critical security failure we often hear there
3:54:18
will be an independent investigation that independent investigation gets set up usually the expectation is between
3:54:24
two to three months after the incident and then nothing really occurs from there the report is usually not
3:54:31
satisfactory to the questions that are usually being raised here and uh most importantly corrective action is rarely
3:54:39
taken um my if I were to to state anything
3:54:44
that I think is profoundly important is that we need to have answers to the public ideally I would encourage uh you
3:54:53
and the agency to be more forthright with the members that still have yet uh to have their questioning because the
3:55:00
public deserves to have full confidence and the stakes are too high the violence
3:55:06
that could break out in this political moment regardless of Party in the event
3:55:11
of someone getting hurt constitut a national security threat to the entire country thank you and I yeld back could
3:55:18
I go back to something you yes please feel free director ma'am if I could just speak to something you said at the
3:55:23
outset uh when you started your questioning uh I want to assure you and everyone on this committee that I'm not
3:55:30
waiting for a report to take action we have been conducting analysis all along
3:55:36
and we have been uh adding additional features to our security details uh
3:55:41
since this incident occurred and I I'd hope you can highlight and illuminate what some of those are uh in
3:55:48
the event of of other members questioning as well very good chair recognizes the uh gentleman from Arizona
3:55:55
Mr Bigs thank you Mr chairman I request uh unanimous consent for that photo to go into the official record without
3:56:01
objection to ordered thank you director your agency has a no fail Mission and on Saturday July 13th your agency
3:56:07
spectacularly failed the failure resulted in the death of Corey comor and
3:56:12
serious injury to two other rally attendees David Dutch and jaames copenhaver besides the injuries to
3:56:19
president trump it is unfathomable that a 20-year-old on the radar of secret service and local law enforcement before
3:56:25
President Trump went on stage was able to climb onto the roof of a building with a rifle and fire off multiple
3:56:31
rounds before he was neutralized was Mr Kooks acting
3:56:36
alone again I would have to refer you to the FBI's investigation was he just a
3:56:42
lone Gun Man I would have to refer you to the FBI's investigation for
3:56:48
motive what did the technical services division determine was going to be the event
3:56:54
perimeter those are questions that we are asking and we are you I mean you're sitting here today come on director
3:57:02
everybody said this you knew you're going to be asked that question because it's been asked multiple times so so
3:57:08
this is an easy one what did they determine was going to be the event perimeter so you should know that I mean
3:57:14
this is not I got to wait till someone else tells me what was it again I don't want to speak to
3:57:21
specifics of the event this this is a specific I understand this is a specific
3:57:27
that you ought to know as someone who said the buck stops with me I'm going to stay in my job I'm going to give the
3:57:32
answers to the American people and I know what happened except for you're not going to tell us and you're not going to
3:57:38
tell the American people and you yourself said in an interview that that fints this notion of conspiracy theories
3:57:46
guess what when you sit here and repeatedly tell people hey I have to
3:57:51
wait as have frustrated everybody on this committee guess
3:57:56
what it undermines your credibility and whether you're really going to get to it
3:58:01
so I'm going to ask you again what did the technical service division determine was going to be the event
3:58:08
perimeter we are still Gathering reports we are interviewing individuals you know you know what it is though no you're
3:58:14
just not going to tell us right when I have those details I will most certainly share those was the gun already on the
3:58:19
roof or did the shooter carry the gun up with him I do not have that information at this time well when was the last
3:58:27
sweep of that roof done prior to the rally I do not have that information at
3:58:33
this time so um how many holds I mean so so most of us here have been in events
3:58:41
and secret service has been there there's been security and I can't tell you how many times um
3:58:47
we've we've said there's going to be a security hold right here so we're going to wait and we wait to one or two or
3:58:52
three two or three minutes uh and and yet we're hearing from you apparently
3:58:58
that there were no holds in place so ever in instituted here with President Trump's uh going on stage and you said
3:59:07
and this is I think connected with this you said uh they hadn't adjudicated the shooter to be a threat he was a udated
3:59:14
to be a suspicious person even though we've got some Dynamic video that Mr Christ morony put on the on the video
3:59:20
Force so I guess my question for you is and I think you answered this I just
3:59:25
want to see if you're consistent with what you said about an hour and a half ago what do you do if a suspicious person is is uh is identified by the
3:59:34
agency so at a number of our events it is not unusual I I know it's not unusual
3:59:39
what do you do those individuals that are identified as suspicious icious we
3:59:45
will send teams out to was a team s was a team sent out here then there were
3:59:50
teams that were sent to identify and interview that individual they they were
3:59:56
sent to interview the individual who's scampered up in camo on top of a roof within 130 yards of his
4:00:05
Target and did they did your team get there when did your team get there to
4:00:11
conduct that interview I don't have the deta s on the timeline it is my so so if
4:00:18
you did send if their team if they did send a team and they're going to interview him
4:00:24
and you said you described that earlier as an investigation why didn't they put a security hold on President Trump going
4:00:30
on stage at that rally at a number of our protective sites there are
4:00:36
suspicious individuals that are identified all the time it doesn't necessarily mean that they constitute a
4:00:43
threat of course not but here you guy got a guy scampering up the side of a
4:00:48
building on top of a roof it's identified to you and you said you sent a team there and and uh you can't answer
4:00:55
that and this gets to my one of my finer points Mr Mr chairman if I can make it and that is we can have these kind of
4:01:03
interview sessions five minutes you know everybody gets a kiss at the pig five minutes and and she get say ston Wallace
4:01:10
not deliver answers so we say okay we're going to put together a congressional committee a blue ribbon committee same
4:01:17
crap will happen I am calling and and I'll support that but I will tell you
4:01:23
this I am calling on the speaker to give us and and put together a truly
4:01:28
independent Commission of qualified former secret service agencies uh
4:01:34
presidential and VIP protect Protective Services people who can actually conduct this kind of of investigation and give
4:01:41
us real answers because I don't think you can you're going to give us those answers you should have come today ready
4:01:47
to give us answers I call upon you to resign today today and I also would say
4:01:53
I've got a bunch of uh UC requests if I can go ahead Mr chairman proceed with the request thank you I I apologize it
4:02:00
might that's go ahead it might take a moment important uh so uh Anthony gelme

4:05:33
we'll stop right there we can retake them on the next one I know there are more but without objection we'll enter
4:05:38
into the record all of those and we'll take up the others uh after the next speaker chair now recognizes m brown
4:05:43
from Ohio for a five minutes thank you Mr chairman I first want to highlight certain comments from ranking member
4:05:49
Rasin my colleagues on both sides of the aisle President Biden and vice president Harris and that is political violence is
4:05:56
completely unacceptable in this country full stop it is an assault on our democracy
4:06:04
itself and I am devastated by this attack on a candidate for the president for the office of the highest office in
4:06:10
the land and continue to pray for the victims this shooting and their families
4:06:16
as someone who has known gun violence firsthand no one should have to experience the pain of losing a loved
4:06:23
one to weapons of war it is deeply unfortunate political violence has
4:06:28
become far too common whether it is the deadly attack on the capital on January
4:06:33
6 The Assault on speaker Pelosi's husband or the threats of violence
4:06:39
against election workers we all must work to condemn political violence and
4:06:45
tone down the rhetoric so director Cheeto on behalf of
4:06:50
the hardworking men and women of the Secret Service can you give us some perspective as into what goes into
4:06:57
securing an an event like the rally like how much time do you have to PR
4:07:02
prepare thank you for the question generally when we receive notification uh that there's going to be
4:07:08
an event taking place at a venue uh the advanced team assignments are made and
4:07:14
there is a 5-day process to conduct walkthroughs coordinate with staff uh
4:07:20
local staff and uh whether it be campaign staff or the protecte staff and then with local law enforcement on where
4:07:27
the perimeter is going to be the the size and the scope of the event how many attendees they're going to be if it's an
4:07:33
indoor rally outdoor rally uh what sort of assets are available locally what sort of assets the Secret Service can
4:07:40
bring to bear uh and what the scope of the event that the the staff is trying
4:07:45
to accomplish So to that point how many agents were recommended or requested as
4:07:50
opposed to how many were assigned so I'm not going to get into specifics of how many were assigned but
4:07:57
those numbers that were requested were provided and how many local agents were
4:08:04
involved in the uh preparation if you will that you talked about that 5-day preparation so there were a number of
4:08:10
local Agents from the local office uh as well as agents from the former Trump
4:08:17
detail that were involved in that advanced process do we have a number I
4:08:22
do have a number I I'm not going to release that number in this setum you're not making this easy for us
4:08:29
um this is a shocking incident on the former president's life and an appalling
4:08:35
instance of political violence and the threat to our Democratic Values I'm thankful that the former president is on
4:08:41
the men and again I'm grieving for the family and friends of Corey compor who
4:08:47
lost a loved one um in this shooting and now know the unbearable pain of gun
4:08:52
violence I really hope this serves as a reminder about our responsibility to attack policies not personalities to be
4:09:00
honest and truthful and to treat one another with dignity respect and thoughtfulness and with that I yield my
4:09:06
ranking I'm I yield my remaining time to ranking member Rasin then thank you Miss Brown for those very powerful and moving
4:09:14
remarks um director Cheeto we don't want to lose a
4:09:19
presidential candidate to an AR-15 attack we cannot lose a presidential
4:09:25
candidate to an AR-15 attack and we can't lose any more citizens to
4:09:32
AR-15 Mass violence mass shootings um and we certainly don't want
4:09:38
an attempted AR-15 assassination uh or assassination
4:09:44
attempt to set off political violence or riots in America so this is deadly
4:09:51
serious business the vice ranking member
4:09:57
um pointed out that a report in 60 days won't do it for us because we have a
4:10:04
responsibility members of Congress have a responsibility to take action now if there's anything we can do to prevent
4:10:10
this so my question for you is what is in informing your operational decisions
4:10:16
right now that you've invoked uh without a report can you tell us what are the preliminary judgments or
4:10:23
if you don't want to foreshadow the report fine what are your personal professional judgments informing the
4:10:30
operational decisions you're making right now certainly and I appreciate that
4:10:36
question uh I I don't want to make any preliminary judgments on what happened on this particular day but I can tell
4:10:43
you that we have looked at uh as we did immediately in the aftermath what the
4:10:48
security plan for the Republican National Convention uh was going to be and we made adjustments to the interior
4:10:54
of the perimeter there we looked at the protectees that we have here in the Washington DC area and our protective
4:11:00
sites and we did make some adjustments uh to their security posture uh and as we continue to move through the next
4:11:08
several weeks uh even yesterday uh with the announcement uh of the the president
4:11:13
no longer running we have made adjustments uh to the vice president's detail we are already prepared uh for an
4:11:21
eventual VP nominee and we continue to make those assessments I think it just shows how Dynamic the environment is
4:11:28
that this agency Works in every day so you've made the same kinds of Common Sense judgments and intuitive
4:11:36
recommendations that members of the public and members of Congress are asking about right now yes okay thank
4:11:43
you are your back Mr chman and before I recognize miss Ma I I have to say director we're pretty close to the
4:11:50
halfway point during this you answered more questions with an ABC reporter than you have with members
4:11:57
of Congress we have a lot more questions the American people are demanding that we get answers to those questions and
4:12:03
that's what the purpose of this hearing is today so uh I'm sure a lot of the questions that have already been asked
4:12:09
are going to be asked again and hopefully we can get some answers to those questions I strongly implore you
4:12:16
to answer those questions you're here with a subpoena and we expect you to
4:12:21
answer the questions chair now recognizes Miss mace from South Carolina thank you Mr chairman uh do director
4:12:27
cheel the American people are watching and they're wondering if there are any
4:12:33
questions you can answer honestly today so director Cheeto I have a series of
4:12:39
questions very specific questions I want very specific answers most of my
4:12:44
questions are going to demand a yes or no answer do you understand I do okay my first question both sides of the aisle

4:15:32
like I I just you're being dishonest here with this committee these are important questions that the American people want answers to and you're just
4:15:38
you're just dodging and and talking around it in generalities and we had the subpoena you to be here and you won't
4:15:44
even answer the questions we have asked you repeatedly to answer our questions this isn't hard these are not hard
4:15:51
questions um have you provided us all Communications from the secret service related to that day and that rally have

4:16:17
know you have no idea the answer is no we haven't gotten a single document or piece of information or data from you or
4:16:25
your agency in related to the rally that we have asked you for so um is this was uh this uh
4:16:34
attempted assassination of Donald Trump a failure of training or execution or both I think that those are answers that
4:16:41
we need to execution or both which one I think those are answers right how many
4:16:46
uh how many Secret Service Personnel have lost their jobs due to this colossal failure at this time
4:16:54
none how many Secret Service Personnel have been required to take a refresher course on how not to let people shoot
4:17:01
Donald Trump our Personnel are currently operational we are examining the facts
4:17:07
of this investigation and we will make the changes necessary what time did law enforcement become a that there was an
4:17:13
individual on the roof with a clear line of sight to president Trump I am still verifying timelines of course uh N9 days
4:17:20
in you have no answers how many minutes went by Between the time law enforcement saw and took photos of crooks and the
4:17:26
shooting how many minutes I am still verifying tim7 minutes thank you Mr chairman and I
4:17:34
yield back G Ed yields back before I recognize Mr stanbury I believe I want to recognize Mr mum for a unanimous
4:17:40
consent yeah thank you Mr chairman I beg your Indulgence I meant to do this earlier I'd like to have unanimous
4:17:45
consent that it be uh submitted for the record the 2023 ranking of best and
4:17:52
worst workplaces in the federal government uh compiled by the office of
4:17:58
personnel management which shows the United States Secret Service coming in
4:18:03
again as I said earlier 413th out of 459 sub agencies uh and
4:18:10
this appears in the July 17th uh addition of government exe without objection to ordered chair now
4:18:16
recognizes Miss stanbury from New Mexico thank you Mr chairman um you know I I
4:18:22
want to start by just saying that part of why you have bipartisan agreement here on the dis about the severity and
4:18:30
importance of this hearing is because this is not just a single shooting this is about National Security and the
4:18:37
security of our democracy it's not just one operational failure this is about
4:18:43
are our public officials safe and what does that signal to our country and to
4:18:48
the world about American Security and the ability of our officials to do their job safely so I want to start by saying
4:18:56
thank you to all of our brave men and women who are in the uniform whether it's the Secret Service or local law
4:19:02
enforcement who put their lives on the line I think obviously we honor their service but this is really about
4:19:08
operational failures and what it means for our country at Large and I also want to reaffirm that uh we
4:19:16
must condemn unequivocally political violence of any kind violence of any kind not just political violence and
4:19:23
that it cannot be tolerated in this democracy and also to offer my prayers
4:19:28
for the slain um fire chief uh Corey comor and also prayers for those who've
4:19:35
been injured now I think you know the the tone of this hearing is how is it
4:19:41
that a 20-year-old young man with a gun that was legally purchased by his father
4:19:49
could on the day of a rally go to a gun shop legally purchase ammunition show up
4:19:55
to a secured site and then not only attempt an assassination of a political
4:20:01
figure but kill and injure two others how could this
4:20:06
happen I'm not asking yet I think we've had a lot of testimony here today
4:20:12
I want to talk a little bit about the timeline now here's what we know and I know director you were also on the call
4:20:20
that we had a few days ago with the FBI and other law enforcement so I respect that uh you are not able to share based
4:20:27
on your testimony some of the details that are currently being investigated but I know you were on the call because
4:20:32
I heard you on the call and you heard them too so I'm going to lay out the timeline a little bit on July 3rd the
4:20:38
rally was announced that it was going to be in Butler on July July 6 3 days later
4:20:44
we know that the shooter searched for dates for Trump and DNC events on July
4:20:50
7th so this is four days after the announcement the shooter went to the site he actually physically went to the
4:20:58
site on July 12th the shooter went to a gun range where he and his dad regularly
4:21:04
go and practiced shooting and the next day on July 13th
4:21:11
he went to the site again before the rally began we know that he then went
4:21:17
and searched online for gun store where he went and he purchased 50 rounds of
4:21:22
ammunition went home got his father's AR which was legally
4:21:29
purchased and returned to the venue at 5:00 p.m. that evening this is more than
4:21:36
an hour before Donald Trump actually took the stage that evening local law
4:21:42
enforcement made aware were made aware that there was a suspicious man in fact
4:21:48
at 520 local law enforcement flagged that he had a rangefinder and they radioed their
4:21:54
concerns and sent around pictures of the individual at 5:40 20 minutes before
4:22:01
local law enforcement uh actually uh identified the shooter and at 551 Secret Service
4:22:09
notifi was notified of the suspicious person by the state police and 1 minute
4:22:14
later they distributed that information that was before Donald Trump even took the stage that was 11 minutes before he
4:22:21
took the stage so the Secret Service was aware that there was a suspicious person at 6:03 he took the stage at 609 rally
4:22:30
goers as was shown in the video identified this gentleman climbing on the roof at 611 three shots were heard
4:22:37
three rounds of shots and of course the president and uh the other victims were
4:22:45
shot this shooter was a 20-year-old young man no criminal record legally
4:22:51
purchased gun and ammunition who for days in the leadup to this shooting was
4:22:56
searching Mass Shooters he even had a picture of a mass shooter on his cell
4:23:01
phone the day of the shooting he searched for explosives he searched
4:23:07
highlevel officials so the American people want to
4:23:12
know how did a 20-year-old young man with access to a military style weapon
4:23:18
actually bring it on to an unsecured perimeter who for days had been planning a mass shooting event and I think that
4:23:27
Madame director with all due respect the answers that we've received here in this
4:23:32
hearing today are completely
4:23:40
unsatisfactory how could this happen
4:23:47
we need answers we need answers not just for the family members of the gentleman who was
4:23:54
killed and those who were injured but we need answers for our
4:23:59
democracy because as others have stated here today we are in a highly
4:24:04
politically charged environment right now we are only weeks away from one of
4:24:09
the most significant presidential elections in in American history and it is
4:24:15
clear that our public officials safety is not been secured and it is not just a
4:24:21
matter of one shooting it is a matter of national security so I hope that you will take
4:24:27
our comments to heart I hope that there will be accountability and we need answers AB
4:24:35
with that I chair now recognizes Mr lerer from Kansas thank you Mr chairman
4:24:40
director cheel I have a question just right the bet something that you've bragged about repeatedly is that you've increased protection for the 36
4:24:47
individuals that the Secret Service is also entrusted with is that correct I think I stated that we
4:24:53
currently have 36 protectees and that we have uh we continue to make AV valuations on where those levels of
4:25:00
protection are provided you've mentioned specific increases in protection that you've provided for some of those
4:25:06
individuals correct correct based on what well some of it has been as a result of the tragic incident that
4:25:13
occurred on the 13th we went back and reassessed where we were at in providing protection and wanted to make sure that
4:25:20
we were not you know overlooking anything uh considering this this most recent incident so the Secret Service
4:25:27
needed to learn that allowing a rooftop 150 yards away from a protecte not
4:25:33
putting that in a perimeter not having someone guarding that roof that information is new to you and it's
4:25:39
caused you to increase protection to other uh folks that under your care I think it is prudent after any incident
4:25:46
that occurs to go back and take a look at your current practices and see if
4:25:51
there is anything that needs to be done differently it's inconsistent because what you said earlier to uh Mr Turner
4:25:57
was that the protection that you were offering to president Trump was in line with the current threats him being a
4:26:03
former president him being a nominee of a major uh political party the threats from Iran the protection that you
4:26:09
providing him was adequate do you stand by that state yes okay do you think it's a problem
4:26:16
that the Americans trust in the federal government is an all-time low do you think that's a
4:26:22
problem I think that it's unfortunate I I don't know why you're quibbling with my word is it a problem
4:26:28
or is it not I think the American public deserves to have trust in their federal government okay I don't know why you're
4:26:35
being difficult I'm I'm just it's a simple question are you concerned about the increasing prevalence of conspiracy
4:26:41
theories going on on out there right now yes I am too you've been incredibly
4:26:47
inconsistent with your answers before this committee today and what you were willing to reveal you've acknowledged
4:26:52
that the shooter was identified with a rangefinder that President Trump's detail was sufficient for the threats he
4:26:57
faced from Iran that certain details were erroneously reported in your words
4:27:03
but you haven't been willing to provide any information about the decision to place the building in question outside
4:27:08
the perimeter the explosives placed in the shooter's vehicle the use of a drone
4:27:14
by the shooter or when exactly the Secret Service identified the shooter as a threat rather than merely suspicious
4:27:20
what is your standard today for what you are willing to answer and what you are not because you've been
4:27:26
inconsistent I'm certain that you can understand that some of the information that's been provided to you thus far has
4:27:31
come from the FBI's investigation and has come from uh information that we
4:27:37
have released I want to make sure that information that is being provided to this committee is consistent
4:27:42
and is in factual but the question about the Drone that the chairman asked at the beginning of the hearing he said do you
4:27:48
know this information and you acknowledge that yes you do know the information you just don't want to tell us I guess my question is is that if you
4:27:56
wanted to wait till the end of the investigation to draw conclusions which you've acknowledged you're not you're
4:28:01
drawing conclusions right now and making changes but if if that was your standard that you want to wait till the end of the investigation to draw conclusions
4:28:08
okay at least you would be uh consistent in that but what what we're wanting to
4:28:13
know today and what would dispel some of the conspiracy theories out there what would increase trust in the with the
4:28:19
American people is for you to let facts out for you to tell us what you know and I want to understand from you why is
4:28:26
that a problem why is it inconsistent with a quality investigation to release to the American people today at least
4:28:33
the information that you know for sure because you certainly know for sure more information than you're willing to give
4:28:38
us today I have released that there was a failure and that there are gaps that we
4:28:46
need to make sure in that they don't happen again that's not acceptable that's not enough that doesn't quell any
4:28:52
conspiracy theories out there in your 27 years of experience would you have been concerned about an
4:28:58
elevated location within 150 yards of a protect that did not have a secret service presence just based on your
4:29:06
experience what I can tell you is that every site and every venue I'm asking for your experience
4:29:12
looking at this situation would that have been of concern to you or would you have agreed that it's fine it doesn't
4:29:17
need to be covered what I have explained today you're not going to answer is it true that at 5:45 p.m. approximately 18
4:29:24
minutes before President Trump took the stage the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit noticed the shooter on the
4:29:30
roof and photographed him is that a fact or not that is the information that I have from the FBI's report yes you
4:29:36
haven't been willing to share whether or when this was communicated to the Secret Service so I'd like to get into the
4:29:41
difference between suspicious activity and threatening activity is it suspicious or threatening if an
4:29:48
individual is seen around the perimeter with a rangefinder is that just suspicious that could be termed as
4:29:54
suspicious if that same individual with the rangefinder is found on a rooftop is
4:29:59
that still just suspicious or is that uh is that considered threatening that
4:30:05
could be termed still as suspicious all right my time is over Mr chairman I yield back thank you chair now recognize
4:30:11
Mr fr from Florida thank you so much Mr chair and obviously want to start by
4:30:16
stressing stressing that political violence is always unacceptable um and acknowledging that this is still an
4:30:21
ongoing investigation but oversight hearings like this are essential components of an investigation and I
4:30:28
want to thank the chair for pulling this together um Madame director I appreciate you for being here the events of July
4:30:33
13th raise serious questions about the efficacy and thoroughness of the security protocols in place the gravity
4:30:40
of the fact that in unsophisticated gunman was able to secure his perch and take a shot at a former president
4:30:47
despite multiple layers of security and intelligent are not loss on me uh before I came to Congress I used to work
4:30:53
advance for a major political candidate and have interacted with many different law enforcement agencies on large
4:30:59
political events like the one that just happened how many times was the Secret Service alerted about a suspicious
4:31:07
person at the July 13th campaign event prior to the first shot being shot
4:31:12
I don't have an exact number to share with you today but uh from what I've been able to discern uh somewhere
4:31:19
between two and five times there was some sort of communication about a suspicious individual to to the Secret
4:31:26
Service specifically according to reports the shooter was photographed twice by security officers prior to the shooting
4:31:33
a police officer saw the shooter on the ground and reported him with a photograph as a suspicious person
4:31:39
multiple local law enforcement officers identified the shooter radioed that he was acting suspiciously near the events
4:31:47
magnetometers um a local law enforcement Tactical Team saw the shooter on a roof and notified other Security Services and
4:31:54
also photographed him one police officer who was photographed The Who photographed the shooter saw him scoping
4:32:00
out the roof and carrying a rangefinder my question is and you've answered this but why or you haven't answered this why
4:32:08
wasn't the event pause right then again I'm not clear on the timeline of
4:32:15
when the Secret Service shift and the counter sniper were notified but earlier
4:32:21
Madam director earlier you said that the Secret Service would have paused the rally if they identified a threat
4:32:27
correct so why wasn't it paused because I have to assume that they did not know
4:32:34
that there was a threat when they brought the president out on the stage I feel like this is a breakdown in
4:32:42
communication between local law enforcement you all and other actors at the rally and again as someone who's
4:32:48
worked on these I understand that there's multiple people with multiple decision uh with the ability to make
4:32:54
different decisions on the ground I've taken the over the last week I've spoken with a lot of folks in local law
4:33:01
enforcement in my district and across the country that I've worked with before and other people have brought up
4:33:06
concerns around um Comm being able to communicate with law en or with secret service during these big events and
4:33:12
having um their Flags taken seriously I do believe that if Secret Service
4:33:17
believed that there was a legitimate threat that they would have paused the rally my concern is before that that
4:33:22
there something was flagged and it wasn't taken as seriously as it should have been taken um so I think this shows
4:33:29
an issue with communication and I want to know Madame director what you intend to do to fix that not in 60 days but now
4:33:37
we are in the middle of a presidential election obviously a former president who had uh who had an attempt
4:33:43
assassination attempt another rally grower who was killed due to this gun violence we now have a presumptive
4:33:50
nominee the Democratic party who's also historic first black woman to be running for president and so I am worried about
4:33:57
everybody's life what do you all intend to do to fix this communication breakdown and making sure that you you
4:34:03
actually take uh what LO local law enforcement local folks are saying more
4:34:08
seriously that's we take what local law enforcement relays to us seriously let
4:34:14
me just be clear on that uh as far as the communication but not this not this time we always trust our law enforcement
4:34:21
partners and have a great relationship with them uh we are looking at whether or not there was a communication
4:34:27
breakdown uh if that was the case we will take steps to ensure that we correct that because to your point we
4:34:34
cannot have a communication breakdown Madam director does the per uh the per you mentioned that the perimeter of the
4:34:40
event did not include the rooftop where the shooter was does your responsibility
4:34:46
and the secret Services responsibility to protect a principal stop at the perimeter of an
4:34:52
event our responsibility is to ensure the safety and security of the event
4:34:57
itself and the protecte who is attending that event and the Personnel who are protecting you would say the fact that
4:35:04
the rooftop was outside the perimeter is is not an excuse for what happened saying that it was outside the perimeter
4:35:09
of the event I am not offering that as an excuse okay thank you I yield back
4:35:14
gentleman yields back chair now recognizes Mr Fallon from Texas how did a 20-year-old loner with a week's
4:35:21
notice picked the absolute best location to assassinate president Trump when the entire Secret Service missed it director
4:35:28
cheel in your leadership your agency got outsmarted and out maneuvered by a 20-year-old how can we have any
4:35:33
confidence that you could stop a trained professionals from a nefarious nation
4:35:39
state those are absolutely questions that we need to have I know questions but you know the fact of the matter is
4:35:44
we can't have that confidence director do you have the ability personally do you have the authority to beef up security of any of your
4:35:51
protectees yes I do okay so were you also aware there was a credible threat
4:35:56
uh president Trump was facing he was facing a heightened security threat to a do to a foreign adversary yes okay so
4:36:04
given that there was an increased threat to president Trump's life was he provided a full security compliment akin to what a sitting US president would
4:36:10
receive he was provided a full complement of Security based on the threat assessment
4:36:18
that we had that's not my question venue my question is if he'd been the sitting president would he have had the same security he had on July 13th or would
4:36:25
have been beefed up there is a difference between the city pres so your answer is he didn't and continuity of
4:36:32
government and the responsibility he did not okay there wasn't a cat team there full cat team on site there wasn't
4:36:37
counter Sur balance teams on site but this is the thing he just said you had the ability to beef up the security you
4:36:44
knew about the threat and you didn't and that's as telling as it is
4:36:49
chilling we have satellite images from the butler Fairgrounds have you visited the site no I have not nine days and you
4:36:56
have not visited the site you should have been there that night did you talk to that evening did you talk to the team
4:37:02
the heroes that surrounded the president did you call them that night they were still operational working so that's
4:37:08
answer is no did you call them the next day president yes I spoke you call them the very next day not the day of or was
4:37:14
it 72 hours after I don't know the timeline but I spoke with them you're under immedately I think it was 72 hours
4:37:20
after you waited three days what is immediately clear is that there are a number of structures that need to be secured of these director other than the
4:37:27
first you know immediate four what's the most dangerous site that should have been secured because you know security
4:37:32
101 you got to mitigate The High Ground yes okay do you know what the
4:37:38
next most dangerous site what was the closest structure to the president other than the four immediate ones that you
4:37:44
had your counter sniper teams on there are a number of structures around that event site you you know who the shooter
4:37:51
knew the shooter has visited the site two more times than you have and he had a drone and he picked the AGR building
4:37:58
so you said do you remember in a ABC interview you did that you didn't have people on the roof of the AGR building
4:38:03
because you were worried about safety because of the slope I recall that statement
4:38:09
okay does the Secret Service have written policy you can share with us about slope
4:38:14
roofs no okay so why' you act like there was one because is it your practice to
4:38:19
comment on enormous uh Na events of enormous National implications when
4:38:25
you're ignorant of the facts that's rhetorical so here's the thing with the slopes you go all up to like 1812 you
4:38:32
can go to a 112 which is about as flat as you can get without it being completely flat and you're saying that
4:38:38
there was a danger uh safety concern there but the problem problem is director you put your counter snipers on
4:38:44
a 312 roof which is steeper than the 112 and by the way the 112 is ADA Compliant
4:38:49
you can build a a ramp for a wheelchair on a 112 roof so these are nothing but
4:38:56
pathetic excuses and they make no sense and they're a bunch of cow Dum all the law enforcement I've spoken with over
4:39:02
the last nine days are amazed at the AGR rooftop was not secure you want to know why because it's
4:39:08
dangerous I have never had any long gun training in my life I own an AR-15 and I
4:39:14
last time I shot it I shot it one time my whole life was six years ago that is until Saturday where were recreated the
4:39:19
events in seavoy Texas where you recreated what happened to Butler I was lying prone on a slope roof at 130 yards
4:39:26
at 6:30 at night and I knew that he had a scope I didn't know what kind Red Dot or magnified so I shot eight rounds from
4:39:32
both you know what the result was 15 out of 16 kill shots and the one I missed
4:39:38
would have hit the president's ear that's a 94 % success rate and that shooter was a better shot than
4:39:45
me it is a miracle president Trump wasn't killed Corey comp comparat to's life is
4:39:52
over because that damn shooter made it on the roof and it wasn't the roof that was dangerous it was a nut job on top of the roof you know what else is dangerous
4:39:58
I believe your horrifying inaptitude and your lack of skilled leadership is a disgrace your obious skating today is
4:40:04
shameful and you should be fired immediately and go back to Garden Doritos Mr chairman I'll you back
4:40:11
chair recognize Miss Lee from Pennsylvania uh thank you Mr chair um I'd like to thank uh the chair the
4:40:17
ranking member for coming together and holding this hearing but I have to say I don't think any of our concerns have
4:40:23
been addressed today and what little we've learned has not Inspire much confidence I I will just say that we
4:40:30
obviously can't allow the violence we're seeing in this country become the norm or a commonplace but that seems to be
4:40:36
where we're heading on this occasion it was you know very shockingly a former president and current uh political
4:40:43
candidate at a rally that we all assume is one of the most secure places we can
4:40:48
be but the violence we saw last Saturday is the same culture of violence that makes too many of our kids and our
4:40:54
community members feel unsafe to play outside or to go to class or to Simply live their lives each day but again this
4:41:00
was a political rally and it is supposed to be one of the most secure places so we do have very uh specific questions
4:41:06
about that director Cheeto I'd like to start by following up on some of the my colleagues questions um my colleagues Mr
4:41:12
chrishna morthy and Mr Frost highlighted a number of points that showed the shooter presenting an active threat so I'd like to ask you director cheeter to
4:41:19
clarify the protocol what the protocol is for postponing or cancelling an event based on a threat and how the events on
4:41:25
July 13th didn't meet those standards so again I think we're talking about the distinction between suspicious
4:41:33
behavior and a threat and at the time that this individual was identified they
4:41:38
were displaying suspicious to behavior I'm still waiting for interviews from the FBI to determine what it was that
4:41:46
identified that individual as suspicious and what those behaviors were to to that question is suspicious Behavior does
4:41:53
suspicious Behavior vary between different events for instance if we have an event with a president would there
4:41:59
not be a heightened standard for suspicious Behavior I think that there are a number
4:42:04
of ways that someone could be identified as suspicious uh and it doesn't matter
4:42:10
whether it's at a rally or an indoor event or who the protecte is I think it's up to law enforcement or citizens
4:42:16
to identify someone as suspicious okay uh thank you according to the Associated Press at least six
4:42:22
different agencies including two Sheriff's Office local police State Police as well as fire and emergency
4:42:28
rescue officials were involved in securing the rally in Butler when there are so many teams uh that are collaborating who takes the lead and how
4:42:35
is that determined the Secret Service is responsible for the security of the site and the coordination and that was the
4:42:40
case on July 13th correct okay changing gears in 2024's
4:42:46
Appropriations budget the Secret Service was given a little over 3 billion which was about 78 million above what was
4:42:52
requested for 202's Budget you've requested yet another increase how much of these funds goes towards training and
4:42:57
improving protection procedures I would have to get back to you on the training aspect of it but
4:43:04
about 30% of our budget is for uh protected protection uh and and
4:43:11
facilities and training but clearly the problem can't be a lack of funding so what exactly do you see as the core
4:43:17
problem that led to this fa failure that led to your agency being outgunned by a 20-year-old using his father's gun and
4:43:24
acting on his own without a particularly sophisticated plan or technology I think that we are waiting
4:43:31
to determine exactly what those failures or failure was uh so that we can make
4:43:36
sure that the Secret Service is stronger after this so we've heard a lot today that you
4:43:43
can't answer because it's an ongoing investigation that you're still figuring out the details and that you won't
4:43:48
answer basic questions you've said 60 days for the investigation but I simply don't think that's acceptable do you
4:43:55
really plan to keep avoiding questions and the American people's questions ours and the American people's questions for
4:44:01
the next 60 days I'm not avoiding questions I want to make sure that I am providing factual
4:44:07
and accurate information certainly but is there no in between right between
4:44:13
what is obviously a fact and what you can surmise from the details that you already
4:44:18
have I assure you when I have a full and complete uh report of what took place on
4:44:24
that day I will certainly come back and make that available certainly studies indicate that the United States has
4:44:30
experienced an increasing levels of political violence and tension does the Secret Service see increasing political violence as a threat to its work and if
4:44:36
so how is the Secret Service adapting its strategies and protocols to account for increasing political uh political
4:44:43
violence we are constantly evaluating the threats that we receive and monitoring that and we make adjustments
4:44:50
on a daily basis uh to our protectees based on what those threats are uh and
4:44:55
and what actions we need to take yes or no do you believe that stricter controls on the availability of assault weapons
4:45:01
would make it easier for the Secret Service to fulfill its missions of protecting public officials I think the
4:45:06
Secret Service is tasked with providing a safe environment which is why we put into place a number of mitigation
4:45:12
factors certainly but do assault weapons make it easier or harder for you to do your job I think that any weapon makes
4:45:18
it difficult for us to do our job okay I Y back chair now recognizes Mr Donalds
4:45:25
from Florida uh thank you chairman uh director real quick at what what time
4:45:33
did was Secret Service aware of the active threat against President Trump
4:45:41
director what time so the Secret Service was aware that there was an individual who had been identified as suspicious uh
4:45:50
and that that individual uh was attempting to be tracked down at what
4:45:55
time I don't have a specific timeline other than to director it's been nine days at what time I I want to make sure
4:46:03
that I give you factual information sir director have you talked to the agents
4:46:08
on the ground that day yes yes I have you've talked to all of them mhm your senior team has talked to every agent
4:46:15
that was on the ground that day yes we have have they all corroborated the same time they identified the shooter or they
4:46:21
were made aware of the shooter either by attendees in the crowd or local police department there are a number of reports
4:46:28
of when those times were made was it five minutes before the first shot rang
4:46:34
out no generally speaking was it 10 minutes before the first shot rang out no it was was it 15 minutes before the
4:46:41
first shot rang out it was less than that time frame when the it was identified as a threat how many days
4:46:48
before the shooting took place at Secret Service actually do their advanced work to secure the facility that the rally
4:46:53
was going to be held at five days in the five days prior when the when the
4:46:59
security uh Advance team did their work did they that did they identify the rooftop as a Potential Threat again I'm
4:47:06
pulling those reports and that information it's been nine days Madam director did they know know that did they notice a rooftop 150 yards away
4:47:14
that was a Potential Threat yes or no I am certain that the rooftop was noticed I am pulling the reports what was the
4:47:20
security par or the security parameters around securing that rooftop there what did they do there was
4:47:27
OverWatch provided for that rooftop did OverWatch fail I am waiting to hear what the
4:47:34
results of the investigation were so that I can identify where the failure
4:47:39
was who who did you talk to that was on the ground that day that was responsible
4:47:45
for OverWatch what are their names I'm not going to provide their names in this
4:47:51
setting did you talk to the people that were providing OverWatch that day I've talked to the people that conducted the
4:47:57
Advance on that day and that we working the shift and we're the counter snipers on that day so you talk to the counter
4:48:03
sniper team you talk to the people who were providing OverWatch that day and you talk to the advanced team correct
4:48:10
yes sir what did they tell you we are putting together a comprehensive report so that I can
4:48:17
identify exactly where the gaps and the failures when the counter sniper team was on the roof and they identified that
4:48:24
there was a there was a susp there was suspicious activity on the roof in question what was the chain of commands
4:48:31
orders around the person on said roof because I'm quite sure somebody saw
4:48:38
in in under your organization Secret Service I'm quite sure somebody saw the
4:48:44
shooter on the roof so what was the communication through the chain of command to deal with said person what I
4:48:52
can tell you is that when the individual was identified by the counter sniper they took one shot and
4:49:00
neutralized that individual but that was after the shooter already took a shot is that
4:49:05
correct that is correct so what you're saying now is that the Secret Service
4:49:10
did not see the shooter on the roof until after the shooter took a shot I do
4:49:16
not have all of those details at this time if you don't have those details after nine days director then what
4:49:21
you're telling me is that you guys didn't see it is that correct I am telling you I don't have all the details
4:49:28
of the sequence at this time director it's been nine days either you have the information or you do not is that
4:49:35
correct we are still in the process of conducting interviews and an investigation
4:49:41
some of my colleagues have texted me over the last couple days bipartisan about whether you should lose your job
4:49:47
and I've been quiet on that question because I wanted to see where what you were going to do today um in my opinion
4:49:54
you do need to be fired immediately and it is because this is gross
4:49:59
incompetence and the fact that it's been nine days and these are simple questions to to answer I'm quite sure if I asked
4:50:06
any one of my kids if they got in trouble and I told them to give me the details I would get more ansers from them that I'm getting from you right now
4:50:13
and that's what's frustrating on a bipartisan basis on a nonpartisan basis this is a joke and director you're in
4:50:21
charge and that's why you need to go Mr chairman i y back chair no recognize Mr
4:50:27
Goldman from New York thank you Mr chairman um
4:50:34
director I want to follow up and just understand a little bit why um there is so much information
4:50:42
about this out in the public including some from you and your Communications
4:50:48
team uh and yet you're here pursuant to a subpoena um under oath in front of
4:50:55
Congress and you're unable or unwilling to answer some of those same questions
4:51:01
can you just explain why uh you are answering so many fewer questions here
4:51:07
than you have to the media I'm answering the questions that I'm able to answer based on the fact that
4:51:14
there are multiple ongoing investigations but You' you have answered some of these
4:51:20
questions previously correct to the public to the media which
4:51:27
questions well for did you have an interview with ABC News yes I did okay
4:51:32
and did you explain uh the interaction between local law enforcement and the Secret Service and that local law
4:51:39
enforcement was responsible for securing the perimeter of the building where the
4:51:44
shooter was I said that the Secret Service is responsible for Designing and
4:51:49
implementing and executing the security plan and that we rely on the assistance
4:51:55
of our local law enforcement Partners to assist us with that plan let me ask you something uh were
4:52:01
you given any instructions about what you can and cannot answer here
4:52:06
today my uh ability to answer questions is solely reflective of the fact that
4:52:13
there are multiple ongoing investigations and I want to make sure that I provide accurate information that
4:52:20
doesn't conflict with any of those investigations that are going on so is it your view that you can't talk about
4:52:26
anything that happened that day until those investigations are completed my view is that I want to make sure that
4:52:32
this committee uh and the American public gets correct and actual
4:52:37
information and so is it your view that that has to can only happen after the completion of the investigation it is my
4:52:44
view that uh when the investigations are complete that we will be able to share that information and how about before
4:52:52
that if I have factual information that I can share before that I absolutely
4:52:57
will I'm guessing you have factual information as to when the suspicious uh
4:53:05
photograph the photograph of the suspicious person was relayed to the secr service there's a time stamp on
4:53:13
that text message or whatever it was correct sir I'm sure you can understand
4:53:18
that uh when you're dealing with text messages emails uh and other
4:53:24
Communications the timelines don't always match up not not really if they're timestamped
4:53:31
but let me let me move on um because you have acknowledged that this was a major security failure is that right yes do
4:53:38
you acknowledge that it was a major major security failure not to secure the
4:53:44
rooftop of the building that the shooter shot from I believe at this time that the
4:53:50
rooftop was provided OverWatch I acknowledge that we are unaware at this time how the individual
4:53:58
was able to access the roof OverWatch meaning from other counter sniper or
4:54:04
other higher points correct um and so was it a failure then that when that uh
4:54:12
shooter was on the rooftop that OverWatch did not identify him before he fired his shots I don't have the
4:54:19
timeline of how the individual accessed the roof where they accessed the roof or
4:54:26
how long they were on the roof let me ask a Qui a couple things
4:54:31
quickly um you have testified here about all the resources that the Secret
4:54:37
Service needed to deploy to protect uh the NATO Summit and all of the leaders here is that right yes um does did you
4:54:46
have to rely more on local law enforcement because of the NATO Summit for this
4:54:53
event the Secret Service routinely works with uh local law enforcement at every
4:54:58
event uh it doesn't matter whether it is a NATO Summit nsse the DN uh I'm sorry
4:55:03
the RNC no but that's not my question obviously there's a natural give and take as to I'm sure how many agents you
4:55:11
deploy and how much you rely on local law enforcement did you have to rely
4:55:17
more on local law enforcement because there were fewer Secret Service assets
4:55:22
available because of the NATO Summit no um I hope we get answers before the
4:55:30
completion uh I don't like the fact that the media has received far more answers
4:55:36
than Congress has um if this is a function of getting your ducks in a row
4:55:43
I I assume you have access to a lot of these reports and a lot of this information and you should have come prepared here today um and I would just
4:55:51
want to flag Mr chairman before you before um I yield back that I I want to
4:55:58
just point out one thing that that my colleague from Texas uh was talking about uh when he said he recreated this
4:56:05
shooting twice with an AR-15 and he had a 94% % success rate 15 out of 16
4:56:13
shots I don't know why that doesn't convince him that we should get rid of AR-15s but clearly we need to do
4:56:21
something about the prevalence of AR-15s and weapons of war on our streets and I yield back chair now recognize Mr Perry
4:56:28
from Pennsylvania thank you chairman director I guess 60 days is the time of
4:56:33
the investigation is that is that the information that you've put out or where did that come from 60 days or is that
4:56:38
just information that the committee members are talking about I stated that earlier today I've
4:56:44
asked okay 60 days so are so are you receiving regular updates you're in charge of the Secret Service this is
4:56:51
about your organization what happened nine days ago are you receiving regular updates from the FBI on their
4:56:57
investigation yes I am so you know some things are true some things are probably not true we want to talk to you about
4:57:03
the things that we're hearing about and find out if they're true have you you've been in contact with the FBI then you're
4:57:09
getting updates on a daily basis right yes Bas based on what you said okay so
4:57:14
and are you confident that the person in question Mr Crooks was the only person
4:57:19
firing that day against the president or the crowd he is he the only one I'm not
4:57:25
asking you yet if he acted alone but is he the only one can you say that with certainty to the American people that is
4:57:32
the information I have at this time yes okay did he does it appear he acted alone that's the information we have at
4:57:39
this time okay now let's talk about the fact that he was noticed as a person of
4:57:44
interest of concern suspicion as you say your Pi team um H how do they stay in
4:57:52
there's a sea of people how does the pi team get to that individual that's in
4:57:58
question in the sea of people how are they how's that individual tracked our protective intelligence
4:58:05
teams that work at our sites are paired up with a local police counterpart part
4:58:11
uh and so they work in conjunction together so they just follow them around or let let me ask you this looking at
4:58:17
the site you have multiple perimeters right you have the secure perim the inside Perimeter you have multiple secure or multiple perimeters was the
4:58:24
AGR so-called building the highest location affecting the
4:58:29
site of the rally was it the highest location I believe the highest location
4:58:35
at the site was where our counter snipers were what about the water tower adjacent what about the how high is the
4:58:40
water tower I don't have the uh height on the water tower okay um seems like water
4:58:46
towers are pretty high at least in the photo it looks like it might be there may be actually be a building right behind the AGR building that is even
4:58:53
higher than the building that Crooks fired from you're familiar with cover concealment and defilade right you're
4:59:00
familiar with those terms yes so how would your sniper team or your Pi team
4:59:06
track the individual and give vectors to Secret Service on the pi team to get to
4:59:12
that individual to question him and how would you cover the defilade the cover and concealment of low areas that you
4:59:19
can't see from where your sniper team immediately adjacent to the president were was were cited H how would you do
4:59:26
that if you're not up on The High Ground so when our counter sniper teams go out and conduct in advance they have a
4:59:33
methodology and provide a grid system uh that our response teams are able to uh
4:59:40
Vector in if they see something that is troubling so when Mr Jordan asked about
4:59:47
the the assets that were requested let me just ask you about assets requested
4:59:52
were were aerial assets requested for this event from either the Secret
4:59:57
Service or State Police or anybody else drone manned otherwise aerial assets were they requested I can't speak to
5:00:04
what the local they were request have conversations with the local police but I can tell you that the asset that were
5:00:10
requested from the Secret Service for the site that day were all granted but
5:00:16
were aerial assets requ I'm just I didn't ask if you used them or what you used were they
5:00:22
requested OverWatch was requested and is that aerial because OverWatch could mean
5:00:27
on the Water Tower or not on the water tower can you be specific ma'am I'm running out of daylight here I
5:00:34
understand if you're asking me uh about specifics whether or not there was is it not clear what I'm asking you were
5:00:40
aerial assets requested by by the president by secret service by anybody
5:00:45
were they requested the Secret Service we felt that we had a a good plan in place okay okay fair enough how about K9
5:00:52
assets with bomb sniffing or explosive sniffing capabilities requested didn't
5:00:58
say they were present were they requested those requests were fulfilled they were requested and fulfilled so was
5:01:06
the crooks vehicle inside any of your perimeters no it was not it was not how did you so
5:01:14
okay so it was not within the it was not so what was there a device located on Mr
5:01:19
Crook's body to detonate the vehicle that is the information that I have so
5:01:24
what would be the point of detonating the vehicle if it was not inside the perimeter I have no idea what Mr Crook's
5:01:32
motivation was ma'am the fact that you haven't not closed with this Mr chairman haven't even visited the site I
5:01:37
understand there are other things going on but the culture of your organization the
5:01:43
culture that doesn't do you know how tall the president is how tall is the president president Trump how tall is he
5:01:49
I don't he's over six feet tall I don't have okay so do you assign agents based on their ability to cover physically and
5:01:56
carry and carry if necessary the president of the United States when you assign them to this mission is that a
5:02:03
parameter that is considered I assign agents to work our
5:02:08
protectees that are capable and have been trained by secret I understand they're trained but if you're
5:02:14
not tall enough it has nothing to do with we're not mad at you but if somebody's s feet tall and you're 5 feet
5:02:21
tall there's going to be a Delta there that is problematic in protecting the protect in I'm asking is that a
5:02:27
consideration when you when these agents not saying you but when they're assigned to the
5:02:33
protecte the agents that are assigned to our protectees are perfectly capable so
5:02:38
the culture is what concerned about because the primary objective here seems to be something other than securing the
5:02:44
site securing the the principle and securing the people at the site and that's the concern based on the answers
5:02:50
that you've given today so far without a yield Mr chairman chair now recogniz sign to our protectees are perfectly
5:02:56
capable so the culture is what I'm concerned about because the primary objective here seems to be something
5:03:02
other than securing the site securing the the principle and securing the people at the site and that's the
5:03:08
concern based on the answers that you given today so far without a yield Mr chairman chair now recognizes Mr
5:03:14
moscowitz from Florida uh thank you Mr chairman thank you for the this hearing
5:03:19
uh I want to thank uh your The subpoena that you sent I want to thank uh ranking
5:03:25
member Rasin and your work the letter you sent to the committee and I also support the creation of a commission to
5:03:32
get to the bottom of what happened director I I just want to give you an honest assessment of how this is going
5:03:40
for you today did you happen to catch the hearing many months ago in education
5:03:45
where there were a bunch of University professor of University presidents and Elise stonic asked a very easy question
5:03:52
and couldn't get an answer did you see that hearing no I don't think I did okay well
5:03:58
let me tell you it didn't go well and the short end of that story was those
5:04:03
University professors all resigned they're gone that's how this is going for you th this is where the this is
5:04:10
headed okay this is I I don't know who prepared you for
5:04:16
this I don't know how many times you've testified in front of Congress but a
5:04:21
president was almost assassinated live on television not just for Americans but for the world to see and this being your
5:04:30
first opportunity I understand there's an ongoing investigation I understand there's things that you can not talk
5:04:36
about but the the idea that we're getting less than you did on television is something that
5:04:42
Democrats Independents and Republicans are going to find unacceptable my high school Marjorie
5:04:48
stowman Douglas was on the list of mass shootings that representative rank Rasin held up that very day the school
5:04:55
resource officer a police officer did not run into the building he hid in the stairwell while the shooter was in the
5:05:01
building he stayed outside never helped okay he also directed other officers who showed up on the scene not to go into
5:05:08
the building when it was determined that the failures in response and training
5:05:16
and that the sheriff fired nobody in his agency Governor D santis then removed
5:05:21
that sheriff I supported the removal so here's my question you said there's going to be accountability I understand you don't want to give us names when you
5:05:27
say that are you telling the committee that once it's concluded you're prepared to fire the people on the ground who
5:05:34
made poor decisions that day I'm prepared to take the actions necessary no no that's that that's nonsense okay
5:05:42
accountability the failure was human that doesn't mean they're bad people it means they failed that day and a
5:05:50
president was almost a former president was almost assassinated okay are you prepared to fire the human failure on
5:05:57
the ground yes or no when you have the names of where those failures were they people it's not like a piece of
5:06:03
technology failed it was people who failed that day are you prepared to fire them I don't have an answer as to
5:06:10
whether well then how can there be accountability if you're not prepared to fire someone and the reason why your
5:06:18
name is going to be the person who's held accountable the reason why members in this committee are calling for
5:06:23
resignation and I join in that or for the president to fire you is because you're saying there's going to be
5:06:29
accountability but you can't commit that people are going to get fired let me ask
5:06:34
this question a different way if Trump had been assassinated that day if the gunmen had succeeded
5:06:40
okay would you have come and tendered your resignation I would still be sitting
5:06:46
here because I would want to ensure the Integrity of the investigation totally understand that's a fair answer that you
5:06:52
would have set up that process but would you have had the honor to come in front of the committee and say a president was assass former president was assassinated
5:06:59
on my watch there should be new leadership I think that I have admitted that there was no no that's what I'm
5:07:05
asking would you have tendered your resignation if he had been killed that occurred on my watch and I am accountable for that okay but
5:07:11
would you have tendered your resignation if he had been killed I think that I've admitted that
5:07:18
I've taken accountability and will take responsibility okay well let me ask a I
5:07:25
want to follow up on representative Connelly's question in which he asked about guns and and you were not willing
5:07:31
to commit that that makes your job harder this is not about the Second Amendment if there were over 400 million
5:07:36
guns on the streets if all of those guns were machine guns would that make your job harder to protect
5:07:42
people again I think weapons that are out there all of those guns were rocker propelled grenades would that make your
5:07:49
job harder yes sir yes okay thank you perfect this is not a trick question
5:07:56
thank you okay I I won't ask the other 15 things I was going to do I was going to do drone strikes but it's okay so
5:08:02
that's all we were asking it it creates a challenging environment it has nothing to do with the Second Amendment or people's rights but it does make your
5:08:09
job harder so credit to representative Connelly for asking that question uh one last thing Mr chairman I'll
5:08:16
conclude you know there was a question asked is an Iranian assassin more capable than a 20-year-old and I have
5:08:21
been tough on Iran I probably have more resolutions on Iran than almost anyone in Congress but I can tell you it isn't
5:08:27
Iranians walking into schools and grocery stores and movie theaters and churches it is 20-year olds right and
5:08:34
some of them are mentally unstable and they have access to guns and they're domestic terrorists someone talked about
5:08:39
Christopher Ray Christopher Ray has talked about domestic terrorism and so yes we collectively come together on
5:08:46
foreign threats and I am not at all debasing the fact that there are foreign
5:08:52
threats here and abroad but there are domestic threats and we have to get to the bottom of how we stop domestic
5:09:00
terrorism because it was a 20-year-old who walked into my high school and killed 17 people he was plenty capable
5:09:06
and he was an Iranian thank you chair recognize Mr Timmons from South Carolina thank Mr chairman director jido
5:09:14
we've asked you a lot of questions and haven't really got a lot of straight answers I have um intentionally created
5:09:19
a line of questioning that I think that you can't answer so the first question is do you agree that the allocation of
5:09:25
secret service resources should correspond with the risk profile of Any Given
5:09:30
event a higher degree of risk at one event should get more resources is that fair that is fair okay and when two
5:09:38
events occur at the same time in the same Geographic vicinity that the risk profile of each event should be taken
5:09:44
into account in whichever event is greater risk should receive greater
5:09:50
resources that is correct okay so I'm going to go over the Trump event so this was publicly announced July 3rd Butler
5:09:57
Pennsylvania the venue is an outdoor Fairground open air no existing security
5:10:03
um the crowd size is was expected to be tens of thousands it end up being over 20,000 um there were were General and
5:10:10
specific threats from foreign adversaries as the chairman of intelligence remarked Iran has said they want revenge as well as um when
5:10:18
President Trump was in office he um made a lot of people mad terrorist to be
5:10:23
included all over the world and you know president Trump is the former president and the future president so I would say
5:10:29
that that is a fairly high-risk event would you agree yes okay let's
5:10:35
conversely um the first lady had an event at a casino in Pittsburgh just doz
5:10:43
few dozen miles away it was a dinner for the Italian Sons and Daughters of America it was publicly announced on
5:10:48
July 10th what's interesting is that the casino is actually extremely secure they already have magnetometers uh existing
5:10:56
prior to this event even being announced it was in a ballroom and the size of the crowd a mere
5:11:01
400 there were no specific threats there may have been General General threats uh and the um asset is the First Lady
5:11:10
um those seem like there's a huge disparity uh relative to risk would you
5:11:17
agree yes okay thank you um multiple whistleblowers and various media Outlets
5:11:24
have reported that the Pittsburgh field office of the Secret Service allocated 12 additional post standers to the first
5:11:31
ladies event and three additional post standers to the Trump rally is that correct there were no assets that were
5:11:38
diverted from the first this is a very simple question I'm not asking anyone was diverted did the first ladies event that
5:11:45
was relatively secure especially compared to Trump's rally get 12 assets
5:11:52
and the first did the first ladies event get 12 assets and trumps get three from
5:11:59
the Pittsburgh field office it's that's a yes or no you don't know don't answer it I mean if you don't
5:12:05
of personnel that were allocated to both of those events were comparable to the
5:12:10
risk at both of those events wow really so you think that the Pittsburgh Casino
5:12:16
400 person in a ballroom with Ingress egress through probably a very well-guarded parking garage was four
5:12:23
times more dangerous than a 20,000 person rally in open field with uh the
5:12:28
former president future president you think that that's four times more dangerous the casino event I didn't say
5:12:34
that at all well they got four times of resources from the Pittsburgh field office who was likely in charge of the final walkthrough for for both events I
5:12:40
mean we've continually highlighted the failures uh of the secret service at the Trump rally and you know you have the
5:12:46
the former and future president getting shot you have uh multiple uh injuries one fatality and I would have to think
5:12:54
that if we had nine more post standards nine more individuals that have the
5:13:00
training and the integration into the Secret Service uh defense of of trump at
5:13:05
that rally that I have a feeling that Crooks would have had somebody come say hello to him before he fired a bunch of
5:13:11
shots what do you think that's possibly true there were significantly more assets and resources available at the
5:13:17
former president's event than there were at the first who made the decision to deploy 12 uh post standers
5:13:25
to the casino uh where the first lady was having a 400 person dinner and only
5:13:31
three people from the Pittsburgh field office to the 20,000 plus person plus
5:13:37
Trump rally who made that decision it additional secret service resources available at the former president
5:13:42
Trump's event who made the decision to deploy 12 to the first ladyes event and
5:13:49
three to the Trump event the allocation of resources is decided based on the
5:13:54
availability of personnel and their location and where they are but there were sufficient resources did you that
5:14:00
were given to did you just say there were sufficient resources president Trump got shot someone got killed there
5:14:06
were not sufficient resources clearly take 27 years of experience to know that
5:14:12
and whoever made that decision it probably wasn't you needs to be fired and then you need to resign because this is absolutely unacceptable and you've
5:14:18
lost the trust of the American people with that Mr chairman I yield back gentleman yields back chair I recognize
5:14:24
Mr TB from Michigan thank you so much Mr chair thank you director for being here
5:14:29
you know when we hear the the headline a 20 year year old young man with access
5:14:34
to an assault weapon commits an Mass you know Act of mass viol violence I mean
5:14:40
we've heard this before over and over again but the unfortunate thing is that my residents don't get a Committee
5:14:47
hearing we have not had one Committee hearing about the over 260 mass
5:14:52
shootings that we've had killing hundreds of people injuring hundreds
5:14:58
changing their lives forever and don't get me wrong to many of my colleagues I mean I watched and
5:15:04
even the pool of blood the screams it was horrific but it made me think about
5:15:11
the images I saw after mass shootings at schools grocery stores I mean I think of
5:15:16
Buffalo New York at a supermarket where a racist gunmen killed 10 Shoppers with
5:15:22
an AR in El Paso AK-47 style assault rifle killed
5:15:30
22 in Florida and Parkland Florida 17 students and teachers murdered again
5:15:36
with an AR in Pittsburgh at a place of Faith Tree
5:15:42
of Life synagogue 11 murdered and don't get me about Newton
5:15:47
Connecticut which still breaks my heart 26 murdered including 20 elementary school children this year in Michigan
5:15:54
we've had Mr chair two mass shootings 21 shot in Detroit biggest
5:16:01
large one of the most horrific shootings we've seen two killed at a splash pad in
5:16:07
Rochester Hills Michigan eight shot there again an
5:16:13
assault weapon used but the difference here is the former president gets a
5:16:21
hearing in his attempt to S but my our residents don't get a hearing about mass
5:16:28
shootings about gun violence in our country you know Mr chair I I ask this
5:16:37
wholeheartedly you know they don't have Secret Service to protect them they don't I don't have these Mass agencies
5:16:45
protecting our kids in the schools or the supermarket movie theaters are going to a black party in Detroit I don't have
5:16:50
that we don't have that but I can't believe we're just going to focus on that and not the fact
5:16:57
that we're hearing yet again in the headlines a 20-year-old young man having access to an assault weapon a weapon of
5:17:03
War many of my veterans say they have to be trained to use but he can get it wasn't safe
5:17:09
stored by the parent grabbing that gun and innocent lives or lost director
5:17:19
I know you got asked about this and and I think it's important though you you know for us to hear
5:17:25
this but how how difficult is your job when there's such easy access to assault
5:17:31
weapons in the streets I think the job of a secret
5:17:37
service agent and offer officer is incredibly difficult I think the environment we deal with every day and
5:17:43
the Dynamics of the threat environment is uh incredibly difficult these are brave men and women who put their lives
5:17:50
on the line and a day like we had on July 13th is a day that no one in my
5:17:56
agency ever wants to have as their responsibility it is it is an incredibly
5:18:01
difficult job yeah immediately thought of the children in the audience I mean when you think about going to Rally with
5:18:06
your family um again their lives are forever changed the incident wasn't are never
5:18:13
isolated I really believe these incidents are never isolated and I know Detroit Free Press had reported that the
5:18:19
20-year-old uh Pennsylvania shooter looked up the 2021 Oxford High School shooting in in Michigan can you comment
5:18:27
on what information this shooter was looking up in regarding the tragedy of Oxford High School where it took four of
5:18:33
our high school youth there I'm sorry I'm not able to uh the FBI has those details so you can't even tell us I mean
5:18:40
was he looking at the type of weapon how many yeah unfortunately I don't have those details you have I mean did they
5:18:46
share that with you though I don't have the full content of what his searches were I think that they are still in the
5:18:52
process of uh examining all of his devices okay um again you know again the
5:19:00
impact I I I want to be really serious about this the impact on our families is more than just this political rally Mr
5:19:07
chair we have to talk about this even if we're in disagreement let's talk about it because I've seen statistics that
5:19:12
show that we could be saving lives now if we ban these weapons of war from our uh from being able to buy it at the
5:19:18
local store down the street I mean we just can't continue to allow this to happen and unfortunately my colleague my
5:19:23
my residents are not former presidents of the United States they don't get a hearing they don't get Secret Service Pro any of that and even among those
5:19:30
that are expressing the failed in the system they just deserve better they truly do thank you and I yield chair now
5:19:37
recognize Mr burett from Tennessee thank you Mr chairman uh miss cheel the shooter was set up on the roof of the
5:19:42
AGR International building as we know was the roof identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally to
5:19:49
my knowledge yes it was were agents or officers inside the building if so what floor were they
5:19:56
on with had local police officers inside the building the roof looks like it's a 10
5:20:02
roof how did no one inside that building hear someone moving on top of a metal roof I don't have the details of all of
5:20:09
the interviews that have been conducted yet when will you have those I have been asking and I want to have that
5:20:16
information uh as soon as as you do as okay why did Secret Service fail to block the line of sight from that
5:20:22
roof I think that the Secret Service put together a plan where they were counting that roof in as part of their
5:20:28
OverWatch and that was the plan that they had put in place that day if you weren't going to put a security
5:20:34
Personnel on the roof why not at least use drone technology or aerial surveillance to monitor the rally there
5:20:40
are a number of times that we do use uh drone technology I'm not speaking specifically to this event and what was
5:20:46
utilized or not uh there are times when drone technology is available and helpful at events and there are times
5:20:52
when it is not appropriate do y'all use signal do you use personally use signal to communicate with any official from
5:20:58
the White House signal on your phone oh uh on
5:21:04
occasion uh I'm sure that there are people that use signal yes okay
5:21:09
do you person do you use it to speak with the White House use signal no I do not okay when was Thomas Crooks first
5:21:17
identified as a person of interest let me help you at 510 he was
5:21:24
uh spotted with a rangef finder at 551 secret and and when did you when did
5:21:31
Secret Service notice him again I don't have those specific timelines but it was a relatively short period of time let me
5:21:37
help you 55 2 Miss cheel why was President Trump allowed on stage 10 minutes after the Secret Service spotted
5:21:43
a suspicious individual that seems to me to be the worst thing of all all the
5:21:49
breakdown and all this communication all the BS you've been feeding us here today are not feeding us that seems to be the
5:21:55
the the question so i' as I've stated before there are a number of events where
5:22:00
suspicious people may be uh identified uh that doesn't necessarily ma'am I I
5:22:06
submit to you you got a guy who's going to be the next president presid of the United States he's on stage I've been to these events we've all been to these
5:22:12
events a car backfires and there's a 15minute dadgum wait that's that's not
5:22:17
acceptable did the Secret Service tell president Trump they' they'd spotted a suspicious individual before he was
5:22:25
shot I am uh unclear as to what the communication was with the former president okay at that time I'll take
5:22:31
that as a no um did y'all deny president Trump's request for more security yes or
5:22:37
no and when was the when was the most recent request for additional
5:22:43
security the rally request uh for security uh all of those requests were
5:22:49
fulfilled and were there any Personnel redirected to Joe Biden's rally no who
5:22:55
made the decision on the direction of of of agents at either one of those
5:23:01
rallies I'm unclear as to your question on the direction of the agents I said who directed those agents to be it Miss
5:23:09
Biden's Rally or president Trump's rally the specific agents so there is a uh a methodology in
5:23:16
which agents are available for assignments uh and they are assigned based on either geographic location or
5:23:24
Logistics or flight I appreciate all that but that methodology about got president Trump killed was the security
5:23:30
detail guarding president Trump a temporary detail the Personnel who are assigned to the pr former president's
5:23:36
detail are uh assigned to him why why was there a different detail on the opening night of the convention than the
5:23:43
the detail that was guarding him in Pennsyvania the president has a very
5:23:49
large uh permanent protective detail assigned to him uh they work shift work and so it could be that people you saw
5:23:56
at the rally uh were not working the same shift the day that he was I could assure you ma'am somebody that's a lot
5:24:02
shorter than the president was not at the convention and the people that were cing down behind the the mass of of
5:24:09
agents that were on top of the president were not in the convention hall at least I didn't see
5:24:14
them you can't answer it seemed to answer a single question about an ongoing investigation ma'am and you
5:24:20
don't know when the information will be released publicly are you waiting for the administration to sign
5:24:26
off no I am waiting for the results of the investigation at which time okay let me ask you one more question you found
5:24:32
explosives in the shooter's possession is that correct the FBI found explosives
5:24:38
do we know how who directed this young man how to make those explosives I believe that the FBI is still looking
5:24:44
into that on their investigation miss cheel you said that the buck stops with me and I agree I don't think you should
5:24:51
resign I think you should have been fired ma'am you are a Dei Horror Story I've told my daughter multiple
5:24:58
times my wife and my daughter we talk to her all the time about how she's going to succeed in life she'll succeed in
5:25:04
life by achieving ma'am you have not achieved today you let the the American public down if it was up to me you'd be
5:25:10
gone thank you Mr speak Mr chairman chair now recognize M Crockett from Texas thank you so much Mr chair and let
5:25:17
me just pick up where um my colleague from Tennessee left off uh director cheel was the incident on July 13th due
5:25:25
to Dei or rather systemic failures in communication and potentially safety
5:25:33
protocols the incident on the 13th has nothing to do with Dei the incident on
5:25:38
the 13th has to do with a failure or a gap uh either in planning or
5:25:44
communication thank you so much in fact um I have a few articles that I will
5:25:49
enter into the record uh once I wrap up that actually uh acknowledge a number of
5:25:56
women specifically um for their Valor in their service whether it's been in
5:26:02
various levels of law enforcement but you know I I want to stick here for for just a second because earlier you had a
5:26:08
conversation in which there was a discussion about training and I I want
5:26:13
to talk about training and I want to talk about the fact that there's been a
5:26:18
little bit of dancing around as it relates to this being a suspicious person and this being a situation that
5:26:25
was perceived to be a threat and it seems as if there's a different analysis that takes place one of my questions has
5:26:33
to do with if you have any bias training that your officers undergo in the the
5:26:38
reason that I asked that because as a civil rights lawyer I have learned so many times in having to deal with law
5:26:44
enforcement that there usually is not a perception of a threat when it it is a young white male even if they are
5:26:52
carrying a long gun yet a lot of times at least in this country when it comes to law enforcement there is a perceived
5:26:59
threat just by somebody having a little bit more melanin In Their Skin So I'm curious to know because a lot of times
5:27:06
one of the things that we have consistently pushed for on my side of things and when I say my side is once we are looking at a tragedy
5:27:13
in which law enforcement made an error um is the bias training and whether or not our officers are getting it so I'm
5:27:19
curious to know in some of the training that you talk about that it's part of your budget has bias training been part
5:27:24
of that yes it is okay thank you um I I know that today is a rough day it and
5:27:31
and on that day in Pennsylvania it was a rough day and the reality is that I
5:27:36
understand it and you may or may not know that answer to this question um in the space in which this event took place
5:27:42
it was an open carry space is that correct that is correct okay
5:27:47
so I hail from the state of Texas and interestingly enough I was serving in
5:27:53
the state house right after there was a mass shooting in El Paso we had an
5:27:58
opportunity to do right by our citizens in Texas but we did not instead they
5:28:04
passed permitless carry and what my colleagues kept trying to get you to answer because we want to come up with
5:28:10
Solutions we don't want to keep pointing the finger and right now you've got a bunch of fingers that are pointed at you
5:28:16
but our job is to solve problems for the American people and to be perfectly honest the numbers are clear I had I
5:28:24
think almost every Major law enforcement agency come forward and say that they were against permitless carry because
5:28:30
they said that their jobs would be made more difficult unfortunately my colleagues on the other side of the
5:28:35
aisle in the state of Texas decided that they would ignore those warnings and they passed the law instead and right
5:28:41
after they passed that law we ended up with Uvalde and we heard the stories of those officers that were scared to go in
5:28:48
and save those babies because of the firearm in which that in that case
5:28:54
18-year-old had in his hands they also were given an opportunity to say hey raise the age and make it to where at
5:29:01
least you have to be 21 before you can possess this type of weapon and they chose not to and we have the facts it
5:29:08
shows and I'll enter this into the record as well if there is no objection deaths from Firearms keep climbing in
5:29:14
Texas decades after lawmakers began weakening gun regulations that is from the Texas Tribune without objection to
5:29:20
order thank you so much the last thing that I'm just going to make a point of saying is that we all care about this
5:29:28
issue because we know that there has been a spike in violence political
5:29:33
violence in this country are you aware of the fact that the numbers are higher right now
5:29:38
okay in addition to that and and I'm going to point a little blame at ourselves because right now you got all
5:29:44
the fingers pointed at you but the reality is that we have a number of congressional members that are consistently engaging in violent
5:29:51
rhetoric and it needs to be toned down the reality is that people are listening and they're paying attention but
5:29:57
unfortunately another thing that is happening because we're not getting answers from you today is the conspiracy theories they have already began have
5:30:04
you heard of any of the conspiracies yes okay the problem with these conspiracies is that when people
5:30:10
believe that say the president of the United States ordered a hit or they believe it was an inside job or whatever
5:30:15
conspiracies they believe because they don't have any facts in front of them that potentially incites the next level
5:30:21
of violence at the next event in retaliation for this so we are only begging for your job as as it relates to
5:30:29
being the director as well as the men and women that you are protecting as their director that you keep them safe
5:30:35
by making sure that the American people have the information that they need so that they can feel as if Secret Service
5:30:42
is on the side of the American people and ma'am I don't doubt that secret service is on the side of the American people but right now so long as these
5:30:48
conspiracy theories continue to Fester it is going to make your job that much harder thank you so much and I yield
5:30:54
chair now recognizes Miss margorie Taylor Green from Georgia Thank you Mr chairman um Miss Cheeto I'd like to
5:31:01

5:32:23
doing well as Mr Mo moscowitz informed you you have been sitting here for over
5:32:29
three hours and I have you know the entire country is demanding you resign
5:32:34
and demanding that you be fired if you do not resign things are not going well for you you need to answer the
5:32:41
questions was there a protective intelligence team and what Technical Resources were utilized for that event
5:32:47
specifically drone or helicopter assets there were a number of technical
5:32:53
assets that were deployed for that event and there was a protective intelligence team that was assigned to that event why
5:33:00
was Crooks able to fly a drone over the entire area the day of the rally and the
5:33:07
day of his assassination attempt to my knowledge he did not fly the drone over
5:33:12
the entire area how did he fly a drone over the area period any part of the area again I would have to go back and
5:33:18
check the timeline of when that took place and when the event why didn't you bring the timeline with you today to
5:33:23
answer our questions I don't have all of the answers on the timelines based on the criminal investigation were you not
5:33:30
prepared today to answer our questions I am prepared to answer the questions
5:33:35
based on the information uh and wanted to be able to provide do you have a timeline that you do you have a timeline
5:33:42
at all from from any of the day I have a uh timeline that does not
5:33:48
have specifics that's shocking I that is absolutely
5:33:55
unacceptable that means you are a failure at your job let's talk about things that are prohibited in Trump
5:34:01
rallies and I've been to a lot of trump rallies backpacks and bags
5:34:08
bicycles Firearms uh any type of weapon or any
5:34:15
other item determined to be a potential safety hazard like a range a rangefinder
5:34:20
would be one uh at 510 Crooks has first observed by one of the snipers AGR
5:34:25
sniper 1 at the building 510 510 president shot President Trump was shot
5:34:32
in the face at 6:11 p.m. 528 ATR sniper 1 takes a picture of
5:34:38
a bicycle in two bags those belong to Crooks 532 a your sniper one spots
5:34:46
Crooks looking at his phone and using a rangefinder 555 Butler ESU command
5:34:54
confirms receipt of photos and States they have been relayed on 6:05 p.m. AGR
5:35:01
sniper one later communicates that Crooks has seen moving Northeast in direction of sheets and that Crooks has
5:35:07
a backpack 2 minutes before the
5:35:12
shooting while President Trump has been allowed to take the stage people see Crooks laying on his
5:35:20
stomach in a sniper position on the roof and they're yelling he has a gun and
5:35:25
they are trying to alert law enforcement and Secret Service why was Crooks not shot by a
5:35:34
snooper by the snipers why was he allowed to be there
5:35:39
as soon as the individual was identified as a threat they were no no no no no no
5:35:44
what do you consider to be a threat a man with a gun laying in a sniper position a man that had a backpack a man
5:35:51
that had a bicycle a man that had a rangefinder at what point is he
5:35:56
determined a threat an individual with a backpack is
5:36:02
not a threat an individual with a rangefinder is not a threat what about a
5:36:07
man laying on a building that has direct line of sight of President Trump with a
5:36:14
gun that people are screaming and pointing out is that a threat Miss cheel
5:36:20
once that individual was identified they were neutralized no they were
5:36:25
neutralized krooks was neutralized after he shot President Trump in the face Miss
5:36:31
cheel is he only a threat once he fires the weapon as soon as the counter sniper
5:36:38
identified that individual they were able to neutralize them how were people in the crowd okay then let's just take
5:36:44
it this way people under your command did not consider him to be a threat yet people in the crowd knew he had a gun
5:36:51
and considered him to be a threat that means that you are a complete failure as
5:36:57
the Director of the Secret Service that people under your command don't perceive a man laying on a roof with direct line
5:37:05
to the president with a gun they don't perceive that to be a threat yet the people in the crowd do how is that
5:37:12
possible that's the last question but please answer the question M uh director I'm not certain at this time how the
5:37:18
information from the people in the crowd was relayed to any law enforcement Personnel no you knew that everyone knew
5:37:26
the people there knew that there was a danger they knew there was a threat to president Trump and it was allowed to
5:37:32
happen was there a standown order Miss cheel was there a conspiracy to kill presid president Trump absolutely not
5:37:39
then how did this happen and why are you still sitting here not turning in your
5:37:44
letter of resignation last question but please answer and then I'll recognize Mr Presley please answer that question that
5:37:50
is what we are investigating to determine we're we're waiting for your letter we are waiting for your letter of
5:37:56
resignation and you you really need to consider doing that before you leave today thank CH chair now recognize Miss
5:38:03
Presley from Massachusetts thank you no one absolutely no one should fear for
5:38:10
their life at a political rally in a classroom in a faith house or in their
5:38:17
home we must do something about political violence in all its forms and
5:38:22
gun violence in all of its forms now director cheel you have noted
5:38:27
that numerous investigations are ongoing related to the Secret Service response and that we can expect a report in the
5:38:33
next 60 days with the election nearly 100 days away that that is an unacceptable timeline and it makes
5:38:40
people less safe it also allows my colleagues across the
5:38:46
aisle Republicans additional time to spread dangerous
5:38:51
misinformation which also puts People In Harm's Way some Republicans have exploited this moment to continue to
5:38:57
attack progress towards racial Justice and gender equity in America disappointing but not
5:39:03
surprising I hesitate to repeat their racist and sexist tropes but in summary
5:39:09
Republicans have wrongfully and shamefully stated that hiring women and
5:39:14
people of color hindered the response to the shooting now this is part and
5:39:19
partiel of Republican strategy to constantly attack necessary diversity
5:39:25
equity and inclusion efforts to undermine the contributions that women people of color the disability community
5:39:32
and others make to this country each and every day and it is disg graceful in the
5:39:38
wake of gun violence and tragic loss of life Republicans are ignoring Solutions
5:39:43
like gun safety reform and instead trotting out sexist tropes can't say I'm
5:39:50
surprised I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record reporting from CNN titled right-wing media figures blame
5:39:58
women in secret service and Dei for security failure in Trump
5:40:04
shooting without objection to ordered this article quotes members of Congress and others that plainly accuse Dei and
5:40:12
the hiring of women as a liability for the Secret Service women have been an integral part of the agency since
5:40:19
1971 and are held to the same standards as their male counterparts to use them as a scapegoat during a time of Crisis
5:40:27
is shameful and it is dangerously divisive in fact based on recent publicly available
5:40:35
demographic data of the agency the largest demographic groups among
5:40:40
special agents are white and male but to right-wing extremists the
5:40:47
truth doesn't matter the lies they tell to advance their anti-diversity agenda
5:40:53
which is a key theme throughout project 2025 will only make the American public
5:40:58
less safe and more divided and every day director cheel that you fail to give us
5:41:05
answers they are given more oxygen to make their baseless claims that women
5:41:12
and people of color are responsible for tragic events and that is dangerous too
5:41:18
thank you and I yield my remaining time to ranking member Rasin uh thank you to the distinguished
5:41:25
gentle lady from Massachusetts and thank you for those trenchant insights um I
5:41:31
wanted to make the the point that that you were making and several of other
5:41:36
members were were making to bring it into sharp relief here um the very same
5:41:43
day that uh Donald Trump uh narrowly escaped an assassination attempt um but
5:41:52
an honored firefighter was gunned down and killed and other people were injured
5:41:57
there was another mass shooting that day uh just several hours later in Birmingham Alabama four people killed
5:42:04
and 10 wounded in a nightclub shooting and you might think oh that's some kind of freakish coincidence not at all we
5:42:11
have more than one mass shooting a day in America they are so commonplace now
5:42:17
that they are barely reported in the national news it's of course local news in Birmingham Alabama that four people
5:42:23
were killed and 10 other people were shot and seriously wounded being treated at the
5:42:29
hospital uh these things are a nightmare for the families of the victims who've
5:42:36
been killed for for the families who have to take care of people who've been seriously injured and wounded they are a
5:42:42
major Financial drain publicly and privately and yet we allow um AR-15s to
5:42:50
be purchased with abandoned promiscuously all over the country
5:42:56
people can just go out and get an assault weapon and the distinguished General lady from Michigan was right we
5:43:02
have a hearing when it affects the president of the United States but on all the other other days of the year we
5:43:08
don't have a hearing about it and I think it is because of an honest
5:43:13
disagreement we have about the Second Amendment there are some people who think the Second Amendment means you've got the right to arm yourself with
5:43:20
whatever Weaponry you need to overthrow the government of the United States and we reject that as a false interpretation
5:43:27
of the Second Amendment and a false interpretation of the Constitution we can ban assault weapons we did it back
5:43:34
in 1994 it dramatically reduced these mass shootings and when that ban was lifted the mass shootings went up
5:43:41
through the roof again and we've shown it and so just like we're demanding real answers and real action from the Secret
5:43:48
Service let us demand real action and real answers from ourselves about the
5:43:55
nightmare of Mass Gun Violence which puts America into a category all its own
5:44:00
when you compare us to the countries in the European Union or Canada or other similarly situated countries there's
5:44:08
nothing like what we're going through so we've got to act on the Secret Service to protect ourselves against political
5:44:14
violence and we've got to act as a Congress to protect ourselves against AR-15 violence in America chair
5:44:20
recognizes Miss mlan from Michigan thank you uh Mr chairman and
5:44:25
first of all I want to thank the Secret Service agents those who work tirelessly to protect our presidents and
5:44:32
specifically those agents who did not hesitate to jump in front of President Trump
5:44:37
and my heart goes out to the family um of the compor family and the people at
5:44:43
the rally who are still recovering um on the other hand the secret service has a
5:44:49
leadership problem and and it falls on you and although I appreciate your
5:44:55
Hollow words that the buck stops here I was actually hoping for some answers
5:45:01
director cheel you must answer to the American people if you want to stay in
5:45:09
charge it's it's really really simple you want to keep your job right
5:45:14
absolutely okay the best way to keep your job is to answer the questions not
5:45:21
play this shell game not sing The Slim Shady song wasn't me I I mean come on
5:45:27
how long did you prepare for this hearing I've been preparing for this
5:45:33
hearing over the weekend and into last week okay five days six days as soon as
5:45:39
I was notified and how long was that about this hearing okay four days I began preparing four days three days I'm
5:45:46
not sure the date that I got the the letter asking me to be here what are you sure of are you sure the color of your
5:45:53
hair are you sure the color of your suit I'm just like tell the American people what are you sure of you don't even know
5:45:58
when you started preparing for the hearing I mean the biggest hearing of your life and you have no clue you can't
5:46:05
remember when you started preparing for this hearing can you understand why those words seem Hollow to the American
5:46:12
people who are supposed to entrust their faith in you I assure you the moment I received notification but you can't
5:46:19
remember you got little Alzheimer's dementia going I mean what you can't remember I have several active
5:46:25
investigations going on in an operational agency to run okay all right but you want to take accountability
5:46:31
right the buck stops with you right I am taking accountability super then let's start with trying to answer some
5:46:38
questions you keep referring to the FBI when asked how many showc casings were
5:46:45
on the roof you referred to the FBI when asked if there were explosive in the car
5:46:50
you referred to the FBI when asked if Crooks was acting alone you referred to the FBI see a common theme here I can go
5:46:57
on and on my question is who at the FBI should I speak
5:47:03
with wait for it wait for it the f is responsible for the criminal is there a
5:47:11
name I'm not certain I'm not certain who all right here we go I'm not certain I don't know let me ask a different
5:47:18
question have you been in communication with the FBI yes I have with whom I
5:47:24
speak with the director and the deputy director okay and what have they shared with you about this investigation so
5:47:31
I'll give you an a an an opportunity to answer again did they they share with
5:47:37
you how many shell casings were on the roof they have shared with me the evid
5:47:42
did they they share with you how many shell casing were on the roof yes and
5:47:49
okay how many were there I would refer to the FBI for their
5:47:55
investigation many were there and their information that they need to share in their investigation so they've shared
5:48:00
the information with you you just W don't want to share the information with us correct
5:48:07
we have concurrent investigations that are going on so they have shared this information with you you know the answer
5:48:13
to the question you just refer refuse to answer the question from the member of
5:48:20
Congress who has subpoenaed you to be here is there a different answer to that
5:48:25
question I was always willing to come here and testify before this oversight
5:48:30
hearing beautiful then let's do that let's let's for once have your actions match your words so you've been in the
5:48:38
in in communication with the FBI you know the answers and you refuse to tell
5:48:44
us the answers so I will ask you again you know how many shell casings were on that roof what is the answer to that
5:48:51
question I think it's pertinent what is the answer to that
5:48:56
question I think it's pertinent to talk to you about the information that the secret service has and that the Secret
5:49:02
Service knows related I'm asking you an answer to the question if you're supposed to be in charge if the buck
5:49:10
stops with you how come you can't share the answers what are you covering up
5:49:16
what are you hiding my friend I'm not covering anything up then why can't you answer a simple question I
5:49:23
would leave it to the criminal investigation to answer questions related to
5:49:28
that when when you talk to the FBI and you ask them how many explos
5:49:36
well let me ask you did you ask them how many explosives were on the roof did they answer that question or in the car
5:49:42
excuse me did they answer that question for you yes yes so you know the answer to
5:49:48
that question that my colleagues have asked you but again you refuse to give us the answers you're playing this
5:49:54
wasn't me well I submit to you if you can't and it's not a can't
5:50:00
it's a won't it's not a can't it's not a I don't know it's a I choose not to
5:50:07
answer the question well let me tell you miss cheel if you're going to lead you need to lead if you want to be in charge
5:50:15
then answer the question or step aside and have someone with the courage and
5:50:20
the guts to answer to the American people the questions that they deserve answers to and with that I yield back
5:50:27
chair now recognize Miss bobbert from Colorado thank you Mr chairman I'm going to continue down that vein um you have
5:50:32
been here sitting today director cheel uh definitively able ble to dismiss erroneous uh information and speculation
5:50:41
however you are refusing to answer questions that we now know that you have the information for you are are saying
5:50:48
that you are wanting to answer questions that the uh secret service has information to Well ma'am you are the
5:50:54
Secret Service you are the director you have said that you are the best for the job so I'm going to ask you some
5:51:01
questions now now knowing that you do have answers from the FBI whom you have
5:51:06
been passing the buck to this entire day and um I'll start with something that
5:51:12
you know maybe the FBI doesn't know because it's has to do with you personally you said you spoke with
5:51:18
President Trump after the assassination attempt and I want to know did you apologize to him directly for nearly
5:51:26
having president Trump killed yes I did I appreciate that I
5:51:32
appreciate that you recognize that this was your failure now since the
5:51:37
assassination attempt you are under oath reminding you have you communicated with
5:51:43
anyone at the White House on an encrypted messaging app like
5:51:51
signal yes or no no I have not are you willing to surrender your personal phone
5:51:57
for analysis uh if I am required to do so okay um I will look into making that
5:52:05
request because I would like to see your personal phone to see if you're communicating over encrypted uh messaging apps have you um ever turned
5:52:12
down enhanced security request from Donald Trump's detail um his special
5:52:18
agent in charge Sean Karan have you ever turned that down no I have not have
5:52:24
there been re has has your team has a secret service maybe not you
5:52:31
personally I believe as I mentioned earlier there are times when requests are made for have denied them they have
5:52:37
been denied and a denial doesn't has the Trump campaign made requests for additional assets that have been denied
5:52:44
denial doesn't mean vulnerability have there been additional requests for enhanced security at maral
5:52:51
Lago uh we have made a number of enhancements to you confirmed that there were bomb sniffing dogs that were
5:52:57
provided you failed to confirm if there were aerial security surveillance uh
5:53:03
assets that were provided so yes or no was that provided
5:53:08
at the rally at the rally yes ma'am we had OverWatch provided at the rally
5:53:13
you've confirmed that the Assassin was identified as suspicious 57 minutes prior to the shooting was the suspicious
5:53:20
individual ever approached by an
5:53:26
agent was any contact ever made with him uh not to my knowledge of is that the
5:53:31
standard protocol for someone who is identified as suspicious
5:53:37
the protocol would be to locate the individual and and you said that he was located two to five times approximately
5:53:44
no I said that the information was passed potentially somewhere between two to five he was never located by an agent
5:53:51
to my knowledge that individual was not located by an agent we have we have dozens of rally goers who have
5:53:57
identified him and not one agent on the ground there are many many many agents on the ground local law enforcement
5:54:02
Secret Service no one was able to identify him and sites on and and see
5:54:08
him what I'm saying is that the agents that were on the ground at the time I
5:54:14
have no knowledge that they were able to uh interview him or locate him thank you
5:54:19
was was there um a local law enforcement officer who approached the roof and saw
5:54:24
the shooter uh and and saw that he was present on the roof that is the
5:54:29
information that has been shared with me have you spoke to that local law enforcement officer no I have not are you going to it is part of a criminal
5:54:37
investigation that the FBI is interviewing those
5:54:42
individuals were agents stationed on the water tower no
5:54:48
why that would not be something uh that would be included in a security plan has a man who is reported to have
5:54:56
been present um wearing a gray suit who allegedly requested a photo of the dead body of the assassin on top of the AGR
5:55:05
roof been identified I don't have that information is that something that you've heard
5:55:11
of no we're ATF agents present at the
5:55:17
rally to attend or to work to work not to my knowledge how long did the counter
5:55:23
sniper have Crooks in his in his sights before the shooter open fire on
5:55:29
President Trump I don't have that specific timeline will you be able to tell us if he communicated with other
5:55:35
agents on what he was seeing through his SES once I have that information
5:55:41
absolutely because we need to know why he waited for multiple rounds to be fired at president Trump before the
5:55:49
threat was neutralized we need to know if he was given an order to hold fire
5:55:55
now it's um you've excused the roof of being um unmanned because of the slope
5:56:01
of the roof do you continue to assert the slope of the roof as a reason for
5:56:07
leaving this position undefended first I'll go back and correct that there was no order to hold
5:56:14
fire our agents and officers uh have the ability to neutralize a threat at the
5:56:21
time you don't I'm sorry you don't know the communication that was taking place or how long he had admitted sites because you haven't spoke to him but you
5:56:27
do know that there was no order to hold fire I can tell you the way that our Personnel are trained they are trained
5:56:34
on the use of force scale that when they see a threat they are authorized to neutralize that threat there is no they
5:56:41
don't have to ask for permission you excuse the roof being unmanned because
5:56:46
of the slope do you stand by that assertion the roof was not covered with
5:56:51
an individual on it because there was OverWatch provided apparently not no there was no
5:56:58
OverWatch provided this is is very evident president Trump was shot a man
5:57:04
died there was no oversight provided I I I find this rather maddening especially
5:57:09
now knowing that you do have answers from the FBI who you have been passing the buck to this entire hearing not
5:57:16
answering a congressional hearing members of Congress while you were under oath and under a subpoena I I find it
5:57:23
maddening that the director um that that our country has come centimeters away
5:57:29
from Oblivion under your watch you have answers you are refusing to give those
5:57:36
to us it uh directing us to the FBI and this entire thing is a waste of time you
5:57:44
you are responsible for the loss of a life and the shooting that took place on
5:57:50
President Trump you do need to resign this is bipartisan you need to be fired
5:57:56
you do not need to hold this position you are not the best for this job I am over my time but I I cannot tolerate
5:58:02
your watch any longer and I'm going to continue to call Daily for you to be removed from your position ma'am chair
5:58:09
recognize Mr Fry from South Carolina thank you Mr chairman director cheel how long have
5:58:14
you been with the secret service 29 years right that's correct and how long have you been director of The Secret
5:58:20
Service just under two years during your tenure as director under the Secret Service I know we're here today to talk
5:58:27
about the assassination attempt attempt on President Trump but how many other security lapses have occurred with
5:58:34
protectees under your watch I don't have a specific number but there
5:58:40
have been uh some lapses there have been other lapses was one of them Jake
5:58:45
Sullivan yes sir what happened there there was an individual who was
5:58:51
able to access uh Mr Sullivan's residence his residence a protecte
5:58:57
somebody was able to break into his house and what happened did anyone get fired because of
5:59:02
that there were individuals who have been reassigned reassigned what other
5:59:07
what other steps have taken what I'm seeing what what other excuse me what other uh incidents have occurred other
5:59:13
than Jake Sullivan was there an issue with the
5:59:19
secret service agent and vice president Harris I would not call that a security
5:59:27
incident well it seems to me I mean you have security lapses with President Trump you have security lapses with Jake
5:59:33
Sullivan you have issues uh with your Personnel related to vice president kamla Harris there seems to be a
5:59:39
repeated theme here would you not agree with that I think that we are talking about separate categories of incidents
5:59:47
well I I would disagree with that I I think there's a repeated theme when you've got protectees and you're not you're not upholding your core Mission
5:59:53
let me ask you something else uh does the Secret Service routinely record Communications between and amongst
6:00:02
detail radio communications any communication
6:00:08
email Communications are uh captured as well as uh text messages and then
6:00:14
depending on the detail uh radio communications are recorded does the Secret Service have recordered
6:00:19
communications from the July 13th event we do not have radio communications from that day but you have text messages we
6:00:27
do have uh emails and text messages emails okay great does the head of the uh Trump detail or someone else embedded
6:00:34
in this detail have Command Decision making Authority or do they need to seek authorization from someone outside that
6:00:39
detail the head of the detail has uh the decision Mak Authority for things that
6:00:45
are necessary for that detail is that standard for protection details yes it is
6:00:51
okay let me ask you something um during campaign events is it common
6:00:56
for the Secret Service to utilize other agencies yes it is what uh other agencies would be providing assistance
6:01:03
to the Secret Service uh there there are a number of other agencies that uh provide assistance to the Secret Service
6:01:09
during campaigns uh we uh utilize Personnel from the Department of Homeland Security we utilize Personnel
6:01:16
from the Department of Defense uh and we utilize local law enforcement partners
6:01:22
are you are you on the same radios do you provide the radios to to all the assets that are taking part in
6:01:27
protection of an event uh we provide radios to the Personnel from the Department of Homeland Security that are
6:01:34
assisting us but not local law enforcement local law enforcement is working on their own radios are you on
6:01:39
the same frequency we uh ensure that we have uh counterparts in the security room and so
6:01:47
the local law enforcement will place uh one of their personnel uh in the security room with our Personnel so that
6:01:54
we have interoperate interoperability Communications let me ask you something just about the timeline because I think
6:01:59
this is really interesting that we can't nail that down I mean I think there are lay people out there with more knowledge
6:02:05
about the timeline than you seem to come before a subpoena in front of Congress was Mr Crooks observed at the AGR
6:02:11
building prior to the shooting he was observed on the grounds
6:02:18
uh outside of our perimeter prior to the shooting at approximately what time was that you don't have to give me the specific minute but at approximately
6:02:24
what time was that I believe it was about 45 minutes or so prior to did did
6:02:30
the sniper the sniper team take a photo of Mr Crooks the the local team did yes so it
6:02:37
was a local team and not a secret service sniper that took the photo okay and did he relay that photo to Central
6:02:45
Command uh again it's an AC of ongoing investigation so we I want to make sure
6:02:51
that I'm factual with the route that that photo took and who that was
6:02:57
disseminated to and when what time did the um did did the did Mr what when did
6:03:02
Mr crooks' status go from a suspicion a person that was uh Under Suspicion to a
6:03:08
threat when did that happen for and maybe not even a specific
6:03:13
time director cheel maybe a certain event that happened that transformed him from a su a person of Suspicion to a
6:03:20
threat when did that happen to the best of my knowledge based
6:03:27
on what I have been told thus far it's approximately 5 minutes to where uh
6:03:32
individuals relayed that there was an incident being or an issue I'm sorry
6:03:39
being worked at the 3:00 of the president so that was but it was before
6:03:45
the shots were fired that is correct but again it was not uh phrased as a threat
6:03:50
it was just that something was being worked yeah but my question is when did he become sus when when did he transform
6:03:56
from suspicion to threat because they're treated very differently people can be suspicious but they're not a threat
6:04:02
until a certain point in time so when did that happen I believe that it was seconds uh before
6:04:09
the guns the gunfire started seconds my gosh we actually have a few questions that we got answered today listen I'm
6:04:15
going to wrap up here uh Mr chairman but here is the frustration that people have the buck stops with you you've said that
6:04:21
yourself but the problem in Washington DC it is the only town in America that
6:04:26
you can be so bad at your job that you actually get a promotion or don't get fired you have not been able to answer
6:04:32
the number of Agents uh whether or not requests were denied on additional security whether or not law enforcements
6:04:38
were able to engage before the shooting with the Assassin how he got on the roof how the rifle got on the roof you can't
6:04:44
tell us how many shots he fired whether the casings were recovered you can't tell us anything about his cell phone
6:04:49
you can't tell us uh whether the rally was supposed to be postponed given the intelligence that was you were receiving
6:04:55
you can't tell us whether the car had a bomb you can't even tell us his motive and the American people are incredibly
6:05:01
distrustful because it has taken 9 days to even get a cintilla of evidence out of you maybe if I was CNN or ABC or NBC
6:05:09
I would have gotten much more thorough and accurate information but we have not receed that in a subpoena Hearing in
6:05:16
front of this Congress that is why the American people are frustrated and I Echo the bipartisan calls on this
6:05:22
committee and all across this country that you should resign or maybe when the president wakes up from his nap he can
6:05:27
fire you thank you Mr chairman chair I recognizes Miss Luna from Florida director sheel can you please give me
6:05:33
the names of the individuals who are in charge of of your conop for the
6:05:38
rally I'm not going to release names can you give me the titles and how many
6:05:43
individuals no we had a full Advance Team that was responsible for advaning how many people are the final approval
6:05:50
Authority there are a number of people that are engaged in approving can you
6:05:56
give me a number no I do not have a firm number can you just confirm whether or not I understand this is an open
6:06:01
investigation but but in order in order to dispel conspiracy theorist have you guys been able to subpoena the shooters
6:06:07
Discord records or has the FBI to your knowledge I believe that the FBI is
6:06:12
working on those okay is it factual to say that you have not ruled out that the shooter was working with other people or
6:06:18
persons again the FBI is conducting the criminal investigation into can you at least in an effort to dispel conspiracy
6:06:25
theories can you confirm or deny that at this time we do not have that there were any other people engaged so you believe
6:06:31
he's acting alone I do okay have you been made aware of multiple I witness reporting that there was a a second
6:06:37
shooter on a water tower I do not have any information related to any second shooter okay uh
6:06:44
the reason I asked that is because according to testimony from multiple Witnesses they did report that and again
6:06:50
I to my understanding there were over 40 sniper teams that were briefed by the butler ESU and I want to make sure that
6:06:57
people are aware if you're saying that there's not another shooter that we are able to clear that information because
6:07:02
from this whole entire briefing it doesn't seem like much information has been able to get out to the American people so I'm trying to dispel rumors as
6:07:09
I'm sure you understand um was it true that secret service was present at the butler ESU
6:07:16
briefing there was a briefing between the uh counter sniper teams that were
6:07:22
working on pres yes to my knowledge okay I want to read you report from people
6:07:28
that seem to be throwing you under the bus and stated that they were in attendance and that secret service was
6:07:33
not in attendance at the security briefing according to individuals with knowledge to also include that the AG
6:07:39
building where the shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks was located um was actually not a part of their security
6:07:46
perimeter for that so there was not Secret Service present um it seems as though that when
6:07:54
you were asked earlier from rep Christa morthy about whether or not Secret Service was aware of a threat you had
6:08:00
said no they were unaware of a threat and yet according to Communications again from La law enforcement that were
6:08:07
in some of these group chats they actually had reported that secret service was made aware of a threat at
6:08:13
around 5:59 p.m. as a part of the command including Secret Service aware of messages and requests about in uh
6:08:21
information about the suspect's location can you please tell me if you have knowledge of that at all again I think
6:08:27
we're conflating the T the difference between the term threat and suspicious
6:08:34
but you guys did have knowledge at 5:59 p.m. according to those group chats did you not of a suspicious individual okay
6:08:41
um chairman in my opinion According to some of the testimony today I feel that you have perjured yourself in some
6:08:47
instances and so I'm going to ask for a full review of the transcripts by staff and if you find that to be the case I do
6:08:53
ask that you bring perjury charges against the director um I will say this it is very frustrating and I've talked
6:08:59
to my colleagues and we've said it to your face that you have been up here basically stonewalling our ability to
6:09:05
get the answers to the American people and what I will also say is that every single member of Congress does not feel
6:09:11
safe with you in charge you have heard that and I think that we are all sitting ducks with you and directing the Secret Service currently uh but more
6:09:17
importantly it sends a message to our adversaries that we are not protected and we are one of the strongest
6:09:22
countries in the world so you have essentially made us a less safe country because of it um as a result of that I'm
6:09:28
asking you to formally step down I share my same opinions as my Democrat colleagues and I also think that your
6:09:35
efforts to bring forward a full um investigation and report in 60 days is
6:09:41
unacceptable and as a result of that I'm going to do everything in my legislative toolkit to ensure that that happen
6:09:46
sooner rather than later and I'm sure that you know that we brought a vote on inherent contempt against Garland for
6:09:52
essentially blocking a congressional investigation and I don't think that you should be any different so um I will say
6:09:57
that I am just completely disgusted by your performance today and I understand that you are probably in a position
6:10:03
where you being told not to test if which is why we had to subpoena you I think that goes back to Garland but again that is part of the uh flushing
6:10:11
that we need to get out of Washington and I would be happy to assist in that process chairman I yield the rest of my time chair now recognizes Mr Langworthy
6:10:19
from New York thank you very much Mr chairman and I appreciate you bringing this U hearing forward with subpoena uh
6:10:26
director yesterday I made the decision to get my car and drive to Butler Pennsylvania in preparation for this
6:10:32
moment and in asking you questions about uh uh the events of of the assassination
6:10:39
attempt on President Trump's life uh i' I've done several presidential Advance uh events in Prior in my career and I I
6:10:45
wanted to see this site with my own two eyes because I don't believe the video footage tells the whole story or looking
6:10:51
at things on a diagram and I was absolutely appalled when I went to the
6:10:56
site when I saw the fact that I could have stood on the roof of that building
6:11:02
the AGR building and hit that Podium with a iron and I'm a lousy golfer and
6:11:07
the fact that that was not included in the perimeter is a complete dereliction of the duty of the US Secret Service I
6:11:13
mean there are very few rooftops that needed to be secured and the fact that secret service as they were putting a
6:11:20
site plan in place did not think it was necessary to man those
6:11:25
rooftops you have completely walked away from your duties you had one job and that's to protect the future president
6:11:32
of the United States or to protect all of the other protes and president Trump is only here
6:11:39
today by God's grace because he had just something in him that made him turn his
6:11:44
head just slightly or we would be in a national period of mourning right now and you have done nothing here today
6:11:51
I've Rewritten these questions like four times during your hearing and you haven't answered a damn one of them you
6:11:56
haven't given any information you have hidden behind this FBI investigation and I think you should be ashamed of yourself because you have brought more
6:12:03
shame to your agency than I think that the assassination attempt has at this point this is literally the worst
6:12:09
performance I have ever seen in front of a congressional hearing I you have offered no reason for this committee
6:12:16
this body or the American people to trust you or the secret service today and you should resign uh you have said
6:12:23
that you've put new security measures in place after the assassination attempt can you tell us what those
6:12:28
are because the American people want to know that you're taking real corrective measures but today you've pointed to an
6:12:34
investig ation investigation or not you still have a job to do with a zero fail Mission but so far there's been
6:12:41
absolutely no accountability and you've admitted that here today not one person's been suspended not one person's
6:12:47
been put on a desk meanwhile we've got the most contentious of el elections in
6:12:52
our nation's history in protectees are in danger because of incompetent
6:12:58
leadership not not the agents the agents piled on President Trump to protect his life those are heroes but the
6:13:05
administrators running your agency they're not right now they're not doing their jobs and you certainly aren't
6:13:11
doing the most appalling part of Saturday's events is the countless opportunities that secret service had to
6:13:16
stop Crooks before he even got on the roof at 3:00 Crooks raised suspicion by entering the rally with a rangefinder at
6:13:23
5:45 a cop with a Beaver County Emergency Services Unit saw Crooks eyeballing the roof at the AGR
6:13:30
International building and then at 555 Secret Service was warned of a suspicious person and identifies Crooks
6:13:36
as a threat this was all before shots were fired 15 minutes later director yes
6:13:41
or no did local law enforcement alert the Secret Service about Crook's Presence at the rally yes they
6:13:49
did the shooter came to attention of law enforcement almost an hour before President Trump went on stage law
6:13:55
enforcement alerted the Secret Service of the shooter over and over you said there's a difference between a suspicious individual and a threatening
6:14:02
individual can you explain what the shooter needed to exemplify to be called a
6:14:09
threat so I'm not clear as to what identified him as suspicious to the
6:14:14
individuals who uh originally clarified him that way for the Secret Service for
6:14:20
an individual to be determined to be a threat that individual would have to be seen uh with a weapon or capable of
6:14:28
doing some sort of harm to our protectees I I I mean director an individual walking into a rally with a
6:14:34
rangefinder scoping out an unprotected rooftop and he reportedly flew a drone over hours before it sounds like a lot
6:14:40
more than suspicious especially at a presidential rally uh your operational lapses your resource management and poor
6:14:46
judgment nearly resulted in the assassination of President Trump I mean the D elction of Duty here is is just
6:14:54
appalling the fact that you haven't visited Butler is just maddening to me that you
6:15:00
you're not taking this job seriously I you know many people here have called for your res ation I've introduced a
6:15:06
resolution here into this body that hopefully will get a vote this week calling on the president to fire you
6:15:12
ma'am you have not done your job you have put a two black eyes on your agency
6:15:18
and you need to go Mr chairman I yield back gentleman yields back chair now
6:15:23
recognizes Mr Burleson from Missouri director Cheeto um I just want
6:15:29
to kind of get an idea of what you can answer um because
6:15:35
outside of what the FBI was responsible for you have full responsibility for the
6:15:41
Department of of secret service so the question is what is the mission what is
6:15:46
your what's who and who defines the mission our mission of the Secret Service is to protect uh the president
6:15:53
the vice president uh their immediate families uh presidential candidates the
6:15:59
former presidents and uh those by executive order and we also have an investigative Mission and and those are
6:16:05
well defined yes they everyone within the agency understands the mission yes they do what about protocols and
6:16:11
standards who defines the protocols and standards we have a number of protocols and policies in place for uh the various
6:16:19
uh missions that we have so would would it be safe to say that you failed the
6:16:24
mission the ultimate Mission I have stated repeatedly here today that there was a failure what about specific
6:16:31
failures within protocols and and guidelines within the
6:16:37
agency again I am uh certain that the investigation that is being conducted
6:16:43
internally as well as the external investigation you said you said earlier in the hearing that there was either a communication there was there was a
6:16:50
there's errors in communication or in operations could it be
6:16:55
both in in both errors in operational decisions and errors in
6:17:01
Communications I think the investigation potentially could uh identify both so I want to talk about
6:17:08
Communications um representative bobert asked earlier about using encrypted apps
6:17:14
that you said you've not used I guess signal um are you have you used any
6:17:20
encrypted app to communicate on from your personal device I do on occasion uh use encrypted
6:17:28
apps to communicate uh so you use some form of an encrypted app to
6:17:35
communicate with with people within the federal government with local law
6:17:41
enforcement whom whom are you communicating using encrypted apps uh many times it's with colleagues and uh
6:17:48
and Associates so you're communicating with colleagues on a personal
6:17:54
device there are times that the Secret Service when we work uh internationally uh with some of our
6:18:00
partners that they don't have the same texting capability big yeah and you you're not able to do that with your
6:18:07
with your government issue device uh recently we have been able to
6:18:12
uh install some of those apps on government devices okay um let's talk about some of
6:18:19
the things uh that we can get access to I'm actually shocked that you are using
6:18:25
your personal device um an encrypted communication tools I think that that might be the most shocking thing that
6:18:31
I've heard today I didn't expect that you for you to say that
6:18:36
um the we have requested this committee has requested multiple documents and
6:18:42
this is not you know in under the purview of the FBI this is under your purview we requested a complete list of
6:18:47
all law enforcement Personnel including Secret Service Department of Homeland Security local law enforcement with the
6:18:54
roles in protecting the president and we requested that to be for us to receive
6:18:59
that by July 18th did we did you provide that I believe that our agency is in the
6:19:04
process process of collecting all documents so you did not you have not provide provided it how long does it
6:19:09
take to determine who the the Personnel were that run site we are collecting a
6:19:15
comprehensive list of all the documents that have been requested we also requested all the audio and video
6:19:21
recordings that your agency not the FBI but your agency has in possession
6:19:26
related to the event did we receive those have you provided those at all we are in the process of collecting all
6:19:32
documentation requested you're in the process but you have not um any memorandums or any internal
6:19:41
Communications related to the to the event you you we requested that you
6:19:46
provide that have you provided any of that we are in the process of collecting the information that has been requested
6:19:53
okay so when can we expect to receive these documents how long does it take to
6:20:00
to to determine who was on site who was who was being being employed to be there
6:20:06
to protect the pre the former president uh when can we expect that how long how many days does it take to provide that
6:20:12
information we want to make sure that we have a comprehensive uh accounting of all of the documents uh that were
6:20:19
engaged in that day and we will make them available as soon as possible I think transparency is the key here it's
6:20:25
shocking to me that we are communicating in in a um encrypted app to colleagues
6:20:31
um I I'm almost certain that violates some federal laws I I would like to clarify you didn't ask me whether my
6:20:37
communications were uh government work related or whether they were personally related you're communicating with
6:20:43
colleagues communicate uh government business with colleagues on a personal
6:20:49
device I communicate on my work device are you using an encrypted device on your work device I am not no no
6:20:55
encrypted apps no I do not okay thank you Mr chairman chair now recognize Mr
6:21:00
Waltz from Florida uh Madam director please I'd
6:21:06
like to direct your attention to this video and and I sincerely appreciate the clarity on this turn up the volume stff
6:21:13
I just want to ask you because this has been this has popped up Republican Congressman Mike walls he said on social
6:21:18
media on Saturday and I'm going to read this for you because it does talk about you secretary I have very reliable
6:21:24
sources telling me that there have been repeated requests for stronger Secret Service protection for president Trump
6:21:29
denied by secretary mayorcas your department has already pushed back on that calling that absolutely false but
6:21:37
he is putting this on you can you respond to that please well that is yeah that's a that's
6:21:44
a a baseless and irresponsible statement and is one that is unequivocally
6:21:51
false director Cheeto did you speak with your boss uh secretary
6:21:59
mayorcas you you fall under DHS did you speak with him on the 14th the day after
6:22:06
yes I did so you spoke with him before he made that statement I spoke with him uh the immediately did you in did you
6:22:14
inform him that all requests for additional
6:22:19
resources for president Trump had been fulfilled I or or that it was false to
6:22:24
say they had been denied I informed him that the request uh for that rally that
6:22:31
day had been fulfilled okay you're you continue to answer that
6:22:37
very carefully because I made a broader statement the agents that came to me made a broader statement that is
6:22:42
permanent protective detail for years now have been asking for more is that
6:22:50
correct I do not have specific incidents of those requests is it correct that
6:22:56
they've been asking for more I have heard the same reports that you have uh
6:23:01
without having them in front of me I am unable those requests are made in writing I mean the agents are telling me they make them in writing this this
6:23:08
isn't a verbal agency things are made in writing I understand what you're saying I don't have those requests in front of
6:23:13
me here to I'm not asking if you have them in front of you are you aware that they were made as I said earlier there
6:23:19
are times when requests are made and depending on the availability of assets or if there is a way that that so there
6:23:25
were times when they were denied if there is a way that that uh vulnerability can be mitigated in a
6:23:30
different way then that is why the so there are times when they were denied for a variety of reasons that is why the
6:23:37
secret service has a multi-layered and multifaceted security plan so that we can pivot if we so in the wake I mean in
6:23:45
the immediate 48 Hours of an assassination attempt on a former president could be the next leader of
6:23:51
the Free World almost had his head blown off your boss says that's irresponsible
6:23:56
and false to say things or denied and you had talk to him so did he just make that on his own make that up on his own
6:24:03
or did you tell on that we were speaking about the requests made at the rally uh
6:24:10
staff can we show the next slide please then we have your spokesman did
6:24:15
you sign off on this statement that there's an assertion that
6:24:20
a member of the former president's team requested additional security resources and those were rebuffed this is
6:24:26
absolutely false in fact we added prot protective resources and technology and
6:24:32
capability as part of the increased campaign travel Tempo but next slide
6:24:40
please next slide please St we have the Washington Post article that then says
6:24:45
we now have senior Secret Service officials saying there were in times at
6:24:51
times when it was denied so which is it again there have been a number of
6:24:56
conversations going on here did you sign off on that spokesman statement the spokesman statement I believe was
6:25:01
related to requests that were made for sign off on on it for the requests that were made at the rally did you sign off
6:25:08
on the statement before it went out I sign off on my press spokesman statement before they go out I would hope you would in the wake of an assassination
6:25:14
attempt yes you did MH categorically false that any requests
6:25:20
were made you signed off on it thank you for that uh thank you for that
6:25:26
Clarity Madam director how many press conferences have you held since the assassination attempt we have put out uh
6:25:33
press Rel press conferences have you held gone to the mic taken questions from the public from the
6:25:39
media how many I have not held any how many is your how many has uh secretary
6:25:44
mayorcas held I don't zero how many has the FBI
6:25:50
held zero how many has the Department of Justice
6:25:55
held I know you know the answer I believe there was a press
6:26:01
conference uh in Butler uh at after the incident occurred by local law
6:26:08
enforcement not by you and not by Department of Homeland Security so this
6:26:13
is how misinformation flies I mean in the darkness in the absence of
6:26:19
information now we have nine days later before a congressional committee we all represent almost a million people and
6:26:25
you still don't have answers are you aware that national news anchors are saying this was a
6:26:31
hoax on National Television they're saying no the president wasn't shot it was flying glass are you aware of that I
6:26:38
have not heard those reports are you aware that I mean there are rumors ramping online that there were multiple
6:26:44
Shooters yes are you aware that because the shooter had overseas
6:26:50
encrypted Platforms in Belgium and New Zealand and in Germany that a lot of
6:26:55
people are speculating there could have been foreign involvement logically are you aware of that yes and did have you
6:27:01
done anything to disabuse any of these Notions today miss it no you haven't D
6:27:09
Madam director I would fire you regardless of the failure I would fire you just how you've handled it since you
6:27:15
should have been the first to the mics to say America world I want to assure
6:27:20
you we're going to get to the bottom of this I want to assure you full transparency uh our agency clearly had
6:27:26
major gaps here and I want to personally take responsibility and accountability
6:27:31
you should have been the first standing alongside secretary secretary my orcus
6:27:36
and I would even go so far as to say have daily press conferences updating
6:27:41
everyone on what we know but you haven't had any of that what are you hiding behind I am not hiding because you're
6:27:48
making the situation worse I think you've heard that on a bipartisan basis here you are making this situation far
6:27:55
worse in the absence of information uh let's move
6:28:01
on this is truly astounding I want to be clear because you keep dodging the issue
6:28:07
has president Trump's permanent protective detail requested additional
6:28:12
assets over the last few years he is clearly not your average former president he's not Jimmy Carter in an
6:28:18
old folks home he's not President Bush painting uh out in his barn he has
6:28:23
multiple residences a lot of rallies he's very publicly engaged and he has a
6:28:30
foreign threat in addition to domestic threats have they requested additional resources that's the last question but
6:28:36
please feel free to director we have continued as I stated earlier to increase uh over the past year uh the
6:28:45
assets that are at the former president's residence and uh supplied to his detail Mr chairman if I could just
6:28:51
ask for one more Indulgence it is clear you'd have not been to Butler Pennsylvania leaders lead and should be
6:28:56
on the ground you have not been there instead you went to the RNC but you weren't originally even
6:29:02
going to go there where were you Ally scheduled to go besides the RNC a national special security event I was
6:29:09
always scheduled to go to uh Mr chairman I would like to enter into the record that the director was scheduled to go to
6:29:15
Aspen hobnobbing around with I don't I don't know who what liberal Elites go to Aspen that was where you originally
6:29:22
scheduled to go to speak at a forum I was scheduled to go to the RNC I was going to leave the RNC for 24 hours and
6:29:31
return back to the RNC I I hope as your predecessor Julie
6:29:36
Pearson with a security incident on the White House and under the Obama Administration and Reagan SEC Secret
6:29:42
Service detailed lead I will hope you would have the dignity for the sake of the agents in the service to resign
6:29:49
gentleman SS expired thank you like to enter a few things into the record uh first of all the remaining articles that
6:29:57
Mr Bigs was uh wanting to enter into the record without objection to ordered next
6:30:03
I have a written statement from representative Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania his district uh includes
6:30:10
Butler and uh he has a written statement that we'd
6:30:15
like to enter into the record without objection so ordered a bipartisan 114th Congressional report titled United
6:30:22
States Secret Service and agency and crisis this was prepared by former oversight committee chairman Jason chaitz and former ranking member Elijah
6:30:29
cumins and lastly uh the issue subpoenaed compelling director cheo's
6:30:35
appearance at today's hearing without objection so ordered that concludes uh
6:30:41
our question segment I want to thank the director for your testimony today I now
6:30:47
yield to the ranking member for closing remarks thank you very much Mr chairman
6:30:54
um and director Cheeto also want to thank you for your your patience um over
6:31:00
the course of what must have been a very long and trying uh a hearing for you uh
6:31:07
it has been an unusually encouraging hearing and an unusually depressing hearing and what's encouraging Mr
6:31:14
chairman is that we came together to issue a strong statement deploring and categorically denouncing political
6:31:21
violence in America and I also didn't see any daylight between the members of
6:31:27
the two parties today at the hearing in terms of our bafflement and outrage about the shocking operation failures
6:31:34
that led to disaster and near catastrophe on July 13
6:31:40
2024 uh what is depressing is the extraordinary Communications gap between
6:31:46
the director of The Secret Service and Congress um and I don't want to add to
6:31:53
the director's uh Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day um but I I will be
6:32:00
joining the chairman in uh calling for the res ation of the director just
6:32:05
because I think that this relationship is um irretrievable at this point and I
6:32:11
think that uh the director has lost the confidence of Congress um at a very
6:32:17
urgent and tender moment in the history of the country and we need to very quickly move Beyond this but what I will
6:32:24
say Mr chairman is that I took this hearing to be about two major policy
6:32:29
failures and one policy failure is the one that got the vast majority of the attention which was the failure of the
6:32:35
Secret Service to um effectively respond to uh a gunman on a roof within uh 150
6:32:45
yards of a presidential visit and speech um but the other failure is on
6:32:52
the part of Congress because the mass shooting that took place in Butler
6:32:59
Pennsylvania um is replicated all over the country every day in fact as I said
6:33:04
Mr chairman it happened that evening um in Alabama in Birmingham Alabama where
6:33:11
there was a mass shooting where more people even were killed and wounded than were killed and wounded in Butler
6:33:17
Pennsylvania so it's true the president the former president the handful of people who get the Secret Service
6:33:23
protection are the only people in America we thought were safe from an AR-15 attack it's clear that they're not
6:33:30
safe either and we got to get to the bottom of that but we also have to get to the bottom of the larger problem
6:33:36
which is that the whole country is living like this in fear and in Terror
6:33:42
of assault weapon attacks in movie theaters churches synagogues mosques
6:33:47
supermarkets Walmarts um you know any place where an
6:33:54
audience or a public gathers and um the worst was in Las Vegas where gunmen got
6:34:00
up on a roof and then just uh mowed down 60 people uh below him and wounded hundreds and
6:34:07
hundreds of other people so we've got to deal with that problem we yes we've got
6:34:12
to move as swiftly as we can to deal with the problems at the Secret Service but the broader problem is still there
6:34:19
and I just wish to uh the heavens that our colleagues that could get together
6:34:27
on the question of presidential security against an AR-15 attack could
6:34:32
get together on the question of public security against an AR-15 attack because
6:34:38
all of us are vulnerable all of our families are in danger by this and the rest of the world doesn't live this way
6:34:45
and we have to look to see how uniquely strange it is that we allow 20year olds
6:34:51
to access AR-15s weapons of mass destruction and show up in public places
6:34:57
to endanger other people and I hope Mr chairman we can work together on that with the same spirit of bipartisan
6:35:04
commitment to the public safety that was exemplified here today and I yield back to you uh Rec member yields back uh I'll
6:35:11
deliver my closing remarks director cheel I subpoenaed you to appear today
6:35:17
to get answers for the American people about the failures that led to the assassination attempt of President
6:35:23
Donald J Trump unfortunately you refused to answer
6:35:28
today and this committee is not known for uh it's bipartisan his model of
6:35:36
bipartisanship but I think today we came together unanimously in
6:35:41
our disappointment for your lack of answers uh you've stated that the the
6:35:48
FBI will investigate and and give a report and you estimate 60 days we've
6:35:54
been waiting for months and months for lots of different uh bits of information
6:36:01
from the FBI we have no confidence in the FBI the majority of this committee has no confidence in the FBI I sincerely
6:36:10
hoped that the hearing today would give not just Congress confidence in the
6:36:16
Secret Service but the American people would have confidence in the Secret
6:36:22
Service we don't have confidence not just in Congress I don't believe the American people tonight when they go to
6:36:28
bed are going to have confidence that the Secret Service is is the best it can be at Protecting
6:36:37
President Biden at protecting the first lady at Protecting President Trump at
6:36:42
protecting their families that's what the primary role for the Secret Service should be and some people have said and
6:36:49
speculated well there needs to be more money and more employees as I stated early on 3.1 billion I believe next year
6:36:56
it's going to be 3.2 billion budget over 8,000 employees if the Secret Service is
6:37:02
spread to th and doing things like uh inspecting counterfeit which is what the secret service was created to do was to
6:37:09
to inspect counterfeit money and things like that with the treasury if it's spread too thin then we need to come
6:37:16
together in Congress and I think we can do that in a in a bipartisan way to narrow the focus of the Secret Service
6:37:23
to protect the leaders of our country to protect our elections by protecting our
6:37:29
our candidates and I don't believe we have any confidence that that you can do that as the leader of the FBI I I
6:37:37
sincerely hope that we would adjourn this Committee hearing and have confidence not just in in in the Secret
6:37:44
Service but in in in you as director of The Secret Service but we but we do
6:37:51
not taking responsibility requires a lot of things
6:37:57
it means providing transparency uh it means answering simple questions it means providing a
6:38:04
specific timeline of July 13th to this committee and the American people I mean it's been nine days there were people
6:38:09
that uh were demanding that we have a hearing the the next day or or two days following the the shooting and I said no
6:38:16
we need to give the Secret Service ample time to be able to answer those
6:38:22
questions nine days nine days and I don't think we answered very many
6:38:28
questions that the American people have I don't think there was a qu I've never said this before and I've presided over
6:38:33
lot of hearings I don't think there was one question asked by anyone that that the average American
6:38:40
hasn't already asked at a diner or at church or at a ball game the American
6:38:46
people have questions they deserve answers Congress deserves answers you were subpoenaed today to provide answers
6:38:53
and ma'am you did not do that so as as Frankie member Rasin
6:39:00
stated he and I will be sending a letter uh requesting that you submit your
6:39:05
resignation as a step toward accountability in uh in what happened
6:39:11
and one of the biggest frustrations that many of us have especially on this side of the aisle is that there's never
6:39:17
accountability in this Administration and when you look at the at the debacles prior to July 13th I mean it would be
6:39:24
hard to beat the withdrawal in Afghanistan the debacle there and no one was held accountable to this day no one
6:39:31
has been held accountable for that but here we have clearly video showing
6:39:37
people notifying the police and the police are blaming the Secret Service the Secret Service are blaming the
6:39:42
police Homeland Security is blaming everybody but at the end of the day
6:39:48
after this hearing and after our requests for information we don't have
6:39:54
any answers for the American people and we don't have that confidence that you can lead the Secret Service to restore
6:40:00
the confidence
6:40:32
e e
6:41:19
okay
6:42:02
got the best
6:42:32
I
6:43:02

6:43:23
[Music]
6:43:32
e
6:44:02
e
6:44:32
e
6:45:01
for
6:45:31
e e
6:46:31
know e
6:47:27
you
6:47:48
want to welcome everyone here today and I know we also want to welcome speaker Johnson uh who is also uh in attendance
6:47:55
today without objection the chair May declare a recess at any time I now uh recognize myself for the
6:48:03
purpose of making an opening statement but first
6:48:08
without objection uh representative Mills of Florida and representative Miller of Ohio are waved on to the
6:48:15
committee for the purpose of questioning the witness at today's hearing without objection to
6:48:21
ordered good morning today's hearing is for the American people who are seeking answers about the attempted
6:48:27
assassination of President Trump a little over a week ago American W Americans watched in horror as a shooter
6:48:34
attempted to assassinate president Donald J Trump at a campaign rally in Butler Pennsylvania the gunman nearly
6:48:42
succeeded the bullet that struck president Trump's head was less than an inch from taking his life president
6:48:49
Trump survived but one rally goer Corey comparator tragically did not two others
6:48:57
were seriously injured it was a horrifying moment in American history the horror was exceeded only by The
6:49:04
Bravery of the law enforcement agents who threw themselves In Harm's Way when shots were fired The Bravery of a crowd
6:49:10
unwavering in its refusal to panic and The Bravery of a bloody president Trump
6:49:16
refusing to run while we give overwhelming thanks to the individual Secret Service agents who
6:49:23
did their jobs under immense pressure this tragedy was
6:49:28
preventable the secret Services protective mission is to protect us en
6:49:34
visiting world leaders and Safeguard us elections through protection of candidates and
6:49:40
nominees the secret service has a zero fail Mission but it failed on July 13th
6:49:47
and in the days leading up to the rally the secret service has thousands of
6:49:52
employees and a significant budget but it is now become the face of
6:49:59
incompetence the committee has a long track record of provid ing oversight of the Secret Service our predecessors both
6:50:06
Jason chaitz and Elijah Cummings among others worked together to issue warnings and recommendations to address obvious
6:50:14
shortcomings in the agency's makeup and operations unfortunately those warnings
6:50:19
and recommendations have gone unheeded a former president and current
6:50:25
candidate for president was shot in the head by a sniper within 500 ft of the
6:50:30
podium this is unacceptable and we are concerned the Secret Service lacks the proper management to keep
6:50:37
protectees safe from Bad actors Americans demand answers but they
6:50:44
have not been getting them from the Secret Service we are instead learning about new facts about the events
6:50:50
surrounding the attempted assassination every day from whistleblowers and
6:50:56
leaks Americans demand accountability but no one is yet to be fired for this
6:51:03
historic failure today's witness secret service director Kimberly cheel is here under
6:51:10
subpoena to answer questions about how the agency failed president Trump and the victims who attended the rally in
6:51:17
Butler Pennsylvania it is my firm belief director cheel that you should
6:51:23
resign however in complete Defiance director cheel has maintained she will not tender her resignation therefore she
6:51:30
will answer questions today from members of this committee seeking to provide Clarity to the American people about how
6:51:35
these events were allowed to transpire we will ask these questions because the
6:51:40
Secret Service and its parent agency the Department of Homeland Security have been unwilling to provide answers to the
6:51:47
American people DHS has sought to push this hearing to a different time secret
6:51:52
service has suggested the hearing occur without media presence and both agencies
6:51:58
have provided only shallow explanations to Congress about what happened on July
6:52:03
13th indeed DHS and secret Services lack of communication with the oversight
6:52:09
committee required me to issue a subpoena compelling director cheel to attend today and still DHS requested
6:52:17
compor to attend today and still DHS requested more time to prepare it shouldn't take this much time
6:52:25
or Preparation warnings recomendations I thankful to the ranking member Mr Rasin
6:52:30
for joining presid I disagree on but that does
6:52:38
matter today this the safety of secret service protectees is not based on their political affiliation and the bottom
6:52:45
line is that under director che's leadership we question whether anyone is
6:52:50
safe not President Biden not the first lady not the White House and certainly
6:52:56
not the presidential candidates the July 13th assassination attempt is one of the darkest days in in American political
6:53:03
history it represents the ugliest parts of what American politics has become
6:53:09
hatred of each other and a dangerous turn to extremism before we were Republicans Or
6:53:15
democrats we are Americans if we place our political affiliations above our duty and love of country we cannot
6:53:22
maintain a country we must ensure our Republic is strong and our Republic
6:53:27
cannot be strong when our leadership our elections our institutions and our candid candidates are threatened by
6:53:35
extremism and violence today director cheet will answer questions about why she deserves to continue to play a
6:53:41
critical role in preserving this country's safety and at the very least what led to the catastrophic deadly
6:53:48
events on July 13th in Butler Pennsylvania again I do not believe
6:53:54
director cheetle deserves to maintain her position as head of the Secret Service but members of the America and the American people will make their own
6:54:00
decisions based on her answers today I urge director cheel to be transparent
6:54:05
and forthcoming in her testimony today Americans deserve no less we have a duty
6:54:12
to find out how this happened and to ensure it never happens again I now
6:54:18
yield to ranking member Rasin for his opening statement thank you kindly chairman comr uh Elijah Cummings whose
6:54:25
beautiful Visage looks down upon us taught us that the way to find common ground in a crisis is to look for the
6:54:32
higher ground and last week chairman comr and I came together to reach for that Higher Ground we made a joint
6:54:38
statement condemning the mass shooting and assassination attempt against former president Trump as a grave assault on
6:54:45
our democracy as we wrote We are united in condemning all political violence I
6:54:52
join the good chairman in expressing condolences to the family of Corey comparator and in sending healing wishes
6:54:59
to the wounded victims also of this atrocious act of violence some are
6:55:04
calling it a miracle that former president Trump escaped this AR-15 attack unlike so many thousands of our
6:55:11
fellow citizens who have been killed or seriously wounded in other AR-15
6:55:16
shootings whether this miracle is of Divine Providence or of an adventitious nature will be up to each of us to
6:55:23
ponder but our job in Congress is not simply to Marvel at Miracles or count on good luck but to act as public policy
6:55:31
legislators to do whatever we can to prevent future political violence
6:55:37
attempted assassinations and mass shootings the chairman and I are thus determined to get to the bottom of the
6:55:43
stunning security failures that enabled this 20-year-old lone gunman who
6:55:48
borrowed his father's AR-15 to perpetrate a mass shooting and assassination attempt at an event
6:55:54
protected by the Secret Service as well as state and local police we'll ask hard
6:55:59
questions of director cheel today in order to to identify and understand the shocking security failures that occurred
6:56:06
and to help transform the operations of the Secret Service to prevent anything like this from happening again but we
6:56:13
can't let ourselves off the hook either dear colleagues what happened in Butler Pennsylvania was a double failure the
6:56:19
failure by the Secret Service to properly protect former president Trump and the failure of Congress to properly
6:56:25
protect our people from Criminal gun violence we must therefore also ask hard questions about whether our laws are
6:56:32
making it too easy for potential assassins to obtain Firearms generally
6:56:37
in the AR-15 specifically Mr comparator former president Trump and the other
6:56:42
rally attendees wounded and Butler are now members of a club no one wants to belong to the thousands of people who
6:56:48
have fallen victim to mass shootings last year we had 655 mass shootings in America defined as
6:56:56
four or more people being shot or killed in a single event not including the shooter 700
6:57:02
people died and nearly 2700 people were wounded in these attacks in 2023 mass
6:57:08
shootings are commonplace they happen at political rallies and constituent meetings in our elementary schools
6:57:14
middle schools and high schools in churches synagogues and mosques and movie theaters and parades in nightclubs
6:57:20
and grocery stores in concerts and on street corners here are the worst mass
6:57:25
shootings in the last uh 11 or 12 years the list is a grim reminder
6:57:32
of the horrific damage and death wrought by assault weapons in the AR-15 in particular that have taken the lives of
6:57:40
our children parents colleagues and neighbors this is a a a very partial
6:57:45
list mass shootings have become so frequent that we don't even hear about
6:57:50
them anymore since the mass shooting in Butler there have already been at least 10 additional mass shootings in America
6:57:57
Two of which took place the same day that former president Trump was targeted
6:58:03
one of the mass shootings on that violent Saturday July 13th happened at 11:00 p.m. at a
6:58:10
nightclub in Birmingham Alabama where four people were shot dead and 10 others wounded this means amazingly that the
6:58:17
butler attack was not even the deadliest mass shooting to happen in America on that day a weapon that can be used to
6:58:25
commit a mass shooting in an event under the full protection of the Secret Service together with dozens of state
6:58:30
and local police is obviously an intolerable threat to the rest of us who do not receive such protection and
6:58:37
obviously does not belong in our communities it's time to pass Universal background checks and build on this
6:58:43
administration's work to ensure that we permanently close the loopholes in The Brady Law for gun show purchases online
6:58:50
purchases and Private Sales to prevent those weapons from getting into the hands of people we know to be a threat
6:58:57
to others what happened in Butler shows why even closing these loopholes however
6:59:02
will not keep assault weapons out of the hands of potential assassins and mass murderers under federal law and in the
6:59:08
vast majority of States even young people not old enough to buy a beer legally can legally purchase and own the
6:59:16
AR-15 and carry it in public the shooter and Butler used his father's AR-15 we
6:59:21
have to find the courage and resolve to pass a ban on the AR-15 and other assault weapons a ban is Broad support
6:59:28
even the New York Post loudly endorsed such a ban in 20 2019 we have passed an assault weapons
6:59:35
ban before Republicans and Democrats together passed it in 1994 alas in 2004
6:59:43
we allowed the ban to expire we know this weapons ban worked one study found
6:59:48
that in the decade that followed the Ban's lapse mass shootings went back up
6:59:54
183% and deaths from mass shootings went up 239 per. but even as we Chang the
7:00:00
Secret Service and act to ban weapon of War like the AR-15 we still will have fallen short of our duty if we fail to
7:00:07
denounce every instance of politically motivated violence in whatever form it takes Republicans and Democrats again
7:00:13
have come together to denounce this assassination attempt just as we did the Violent attempts on the lives of our
7:00:19
colleagues Representative Steven scales and representative Gabby gords and on Paul Pelosi the husband of speaker Nancy
7:00:27
Pelosi who was attacked and brutalized in his home and in the immediate aftermath of the January 6th Mass
7:00:33
violence waged against Congress and the vice president and the Constitutional transfer of power Democrats and
7:00:39
Republicans alike including Senator McConnell chairman comr and other colleagues all denounced this violent
7:00:45
assault on our democracy that wounded approximately 140 officers from the US
7:00:51
Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department and I commend them for
7:00:56
acting to uh denounce that attack just as Democrats moved swiftly to denounce
7:01:03
the attack on Congressman kise scalise police scientists political scientists
7:01:08
tell us that authoritarian attacks on Democratic institutions begin with political parties refusing to disavow or
7:01:15
openly embracing political violence we have to reject that on a strong bipartisan basis as chairman comr and I
7:01:22
have done even as we ensure our secret service is up to its vital task of protecting presidents and candidates and
7:01:29
as we work to ensure that America the streets of our country are free from the violence of weapons of war thank you Mr
7:01:35

7:03:34
appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today the assassination attempt of former president Donald Trump
7:03:39
on July 13th is the most significant operational failure of the Secret
7:03:45
Service in decades and I am keeping him and his family in my thoughts I would
7:03:51
like to offer my sincerest condolences to the family of Corey comparator a former Fire Chief and a hero who was

7:04:11
the passing of your colleague congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee Miss Jackson Lee was always engaged in the
7:04:17
oversight of the Secret Service and her passing is a great loss to this body the secret service's solemn mission
7:04:24
is to protect our nation's leaders on July 13th we failed as a director of the
7:04:31
United state secret service I take full responsibility for any security lapse of
7:04:36
our agency we are fully cooperating with ongoing investigations we must learn what
7:04:43
happened and I will move Heaven and Earth to ensure that an incident like July 13th does not happen again let me
7:04:51
State unequivocally nothing I have said should be interpreted to place blame for this
7:04:57
failure on our federal state or local law enforcement Partners who supported the Secret Service in Butler we could
7:05:04
not do our job without them we rely on the relationships built over years of working together to secure events and
7:05:10
conduct investigations our agents officers and support Personnel understand that every
7:05:16
day we are expected to sacrifice Our Lives to execute a no- fail
7:05:22
Mission as witnessed on July 13th our special agents shielded former president
7:05:27
Trump with their own bodies on stage while shots were being
7:05:33
fired selflessly willing to make the ultimate sacrifice without hesitation I
7:05:38
am proud beyond words of the actions taken by the former president's detail the counter sniper team who neutralized
7:05:44
the gunmen and the Tactical Team who was prepared to act I will be transparent as
7:05:50
possible when I speak with you understanding though at times that I may be limited in providing a thorough
7:05:56
response in this open setting due to Associated risks with sharing highly
7:06:02
sensitive protective methodologies I do not want to inadvertently provide you today with inaccurate
7:06:08
information since January 1st 2024 the secret service has successfully secured
7:06:13
over 7,500 sites every protective Advance comes with its own set of challenges and requires a customized
7:06:20
mitigation strategy including specific assets security plans are multi-layered
7:06:26
providing 360 degrees of protection these layers include person
7:06:32
Technical and tactical assets which are a force multiplier for our protective
7:06:37
posture during every Advance we attempt to strike a balance between enabling the protecte to be visible and our
7:06:44
protective requirements to be secure I know this because I have spent 29 years
7:06:50
in this agency I came up through the ranks I've secured events for every president since President Clinton
7:06:57
supervised on vice president Cheney's detail LED our training center oversaw all of the investigations and protective
7:07:04
visits in the state of Georgia supervised on Vice President Biden's detail and the agency's entire
7:07:10
protective Mission during the Trump Administration the comprehensive advanced process involves collaborative
7:07:16
planning between our secret service the protectees staff local law enforcement
7:07:22
partners and the level of security provided for the former president increased well before the campaign and
7:07:28
has been steadily increasing as threats evolve the security plan included a full
7:07:34
assessment of the Butler Farm Show showgrounds to identify security vulnerabilities and craft a security
7:07:40
plan for the protecte attendees and the public immediately following the
7:07:46
assassination attempt I directed the activation of my crisis center I assembled my executive team to begin
7:07:52
surging more protective resources to the former president and to ensure the wellness of our people post incident all
7:07:58
while securing an active crime scene I immediately ordered a reevaluation of the Republican National Convention
7:08:04
security plan and I increased the security posture in the national capital region for all permanent protectees and
7:08:10
sites at the same time I initiated a mission Assurance investigation within our agency I have instructed my team
7:08:17
that all necessary resources will be dedicated to investigating these manners we will not rest until we have explored
7:08:25
every option and we will leave no stone unturned but I want to be clear I am not
7:08:31
waiting for these investigations to be completed prior to making changes over the past two weeks we
7:08:37
successfully led the planning and execution of the 75th NATO Summit and the Republican National Convention over
7:08:43
the next few months we will Implement security plans for the Democratic National Convention the United Nations General Assembly and have already begun
7:08:49
planning and coordinating the 2025 inauguration it is now more important than ever for the men and women of the
7:08:55
Secret Service to remain resilient and to focus on what is necessary to carry out our critical Mission our agency
7:09:03
needs to be adequately resourced in order to serve our current Mission requirements and anticipate future
7:09:09
requirements the Secret Service currently protects 36 individuals on a daily basis as well as world leaders who
7:09:15
visit the United States like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who arrived in Washington DC today the
7:09:22
coming years will bring an unprecedented heavy protection Tempo I have no doubt that the processes that I have imple
7:09:29
implemented during my tenure as director in in addition to my nearly 30 years of experience in this agency have
7:09:34
positioned the Secret Service to be stronger our mission is not political it
7:09:40
is literally a matter of life and death and the tragic events on July 13th remind us of that I have full confidence
7:09:47
in the men and women of the Secret Service they are worthy of our support and executing our protective Mission I
7:09:54
will now answer any questions that the committee may have thank you very much director cheel we'll now begin our our
7:10:00
five minutes uh questions and I will begin just for the record the secret
7:10:06
service has an annual budget of around 3.1 billion dollars and I believe around
7:10:12
8,000 employees is that correct yes sir obviously there were many security failures on the day of the attempted
7:10:18
assassination and leading up to that day let's start with the building that the shooter used to shoot president Trump
7:10:24
from at any point Saturday did the Secret Service have an agent on top of
7:10:29
that roof sir I'm sure as you can imagine that we are just nine days out from this uh
7:10:36
incident and there's still an ongoing investigation and so I want to make sure that any information that we are
7:10:42
providing to you is factual you can't okay why did the Secret Service not can you answer why the Secret Service didn't
7:10:48
place a single agent on the roof we are still looking into the advanced process and the decisions okay
7:10:56
okay let's wasn't that building within the perimeter
7:11:01
that should be secured do we agree with that the building was outside of the
7:11:06
perimeter on the day of the visit but again that is one of the things that during the investigation we want to take
7:11:12
a look at and determine whether or not other decisions should have been made one of the things that you said I
7:11:19
believe in an interview that there wasn't an agent on the roof because it was a slope roof is that is that normal
7:11:26
and do you fear that that immediately creates an opportunity for future would
7:11:31
be assassins to look for a slanted roof I mean it it this is a huge question
7:11:37
that every American has why wasn't a secret service agent on the roof and there have been reports that agents were
7:11:43
supposed to be on the roof but it was hot that day and they didn't want to be on the roof can you answer any of those questions director so I appreciate you
7:11:50
asking me that question chairman uh I should have been more clear in my answer when I spoke about where we placed
7:11:55
Personnel in that interview uh what I can tell you is that uh there was a plan in place to provide OverWatch and we are
7:12:03
still looking into responsibilities and who is going to provide OverWatch uh but the Secret Service in general not
7:12:10
speaking specifically to this incident when we are providing OverWatch whether that be through counter snipers or other
7:12:16
technology prefer to have sterile rooftops did the Secret Service use any
7:12:21
drones for surveillance that day so again I'm not going to get into specifics of that day in itself but
7:12:28
there are times uh during a security plan that the Secret Service does deploy an asset like a drone there were reports
7:12:35
that the shooter used a drone just a few hours before the rally start time is
7:12:40
that accurate I have heard those same reports and again am waiting for the final
7:12:46
report do you know if you can't answer the question that's your answer but can you
7:12:52
answer this do you know do you know I'm not asking yes or no but do you know if
7:12:58
the shooter used a drone before for the shooting that information has been
7:13:03
passed to us from the FBI how many Secret Service agents were assigned to president Trump on the day
7:13:09
of the rally again I'm not going to get into the specifics of the numbers of personnel that we had there but we feel
7:13:18
that there was a sufficient number of Agents assigned there are reports that several agents assigned to the rally on
7:13:23
July 13th were were temporary agents agents not normally assigned to president Trump is that
7:13:29
accurate what I can tell you is that the agents that were assigned to former president Trump are Secret Service
7:13:36
agents that provide close protection to him and that was what was actual on that
7:13:41
day how many temporary agents were there that day quite frequently sir during campaign
7:13:47
events uh the Secret Service utilizes uh Agents from HSI or the department of
7:13:53
home security you don't know how many supplement our plan have the investigators reconstructed the shooters
7:13:59
precise movements over the past days weeks and months so again we need we need to have
7:14:07
confidence that if the FBI is leading this investigation that they're leading a
7:14:13
credible investigation because there's some of us sitting up here today that don't have a lot of confidence in the FBI so I will repeat the question have
7:14:20
the investigators reconstructed the shooters precise moments over the past days weeks and months I understand your
7:14:27
question chairman and I share your concerns about wanting to make sure that we have factual information the FBI is
7:14:34
conducting a criminal investigation the Secret Service is conducting an internal investigation there are a number of oig
7:14:40
Investigations and there is the external investigation the president last question for me before July
7:14:47
13th had the Trump detail requested additional resources what I can tell you is that
7:14:53
for the event on July 13th the details that were requ the the assets that were requested for that day were given
7:15:02
okay my time has expired chair no recognize as ranking member asking for five minutes thank you Mr chairman um
7:15:08
it's been um reported that before former president Trump got up on the stage at
7:15:14
around 6: pm on Saturday July 13th that the local police had identified and even
7:15:20
photographed a man who was acting suspiciously and this man who turned out to be the gunman had been flagged as a
7:15:27
Potential Threat is that accurate what I can say is that the individual
7:15:33
was identified as suspicious so he was known to be suspicious before former president Trump
7:15:41
took the stage that is the information I have received why was he allowed to take the
7:15:46
stage with a suspicious person having been identified in the crime so I
7:15:52
appreciate the question and I'd like to make two points if the detail had been past
7:15:58
information that there was a threat that the detail would never have brought the former president out onto stage that is
7:16:05
what we do and that is who we are we are charged with protecting uh all all of
7:16:10
our protees so you distinguish between someone who is suspicious and someone who's threatening is that right I do
7:16:16
there are a number of times at protective events where suspicious people are identified and those
7:16:21
individuals have to be investigated and determined what is it that identifies
7:16:26
that person as suspicious so did you deny um a request for additional
7:16:31
resources that had been made by uh the Trump campaign there were no assets
7:16:37
denied for that event in Butler on the 13th I see so you're saying there were
7:16:44
requests made for additional assistance for other specific events rather than for the campaign as a whole is that
7:16:50
right I'm sorry I'm not understand well you seem to say that there were not additional resources requested for that
7:16:57
event and uh forgive me for being unfamiliar with this is it requested event by event or is it
7:17:04
requested just in general for the campaign so if I can explain the
7:17:10
advanced process uh when the when a an event or an venue is identified by in
7:17:15
this case campaign staff uh then the campaign staff works together with Secret Service agents who go out and
7:17:22
conduct in advance generally that is a five-day time period uh where those discussions are had about what the
7:17:29
perimeter is going to look like what the size of the event is what the venue is and then from there uh there is a
7:17:35
request made uh to mitigate potential risk and threat and I'm saying that on
7:17:41
that day the requests that were pushed forward were granted so the Secret Service did not know that the gunman
7:17:47
actually had a weapon before President Trump was allowed to get up on the stage to the best of our knowledge and the
7:17:53
facts that we have at this point that is correct um so can you answer this question which I think is on the mind of
7:18:00
most Americans thinking about this how can a 20-year-old with his father's AR-15 assault weapon climb onto a roof
7:18:08
with a direct 150 yard line of sight to the speaker Podium without the Secret
7:18:15
Service or local police stopping him so again sir I will say we are nine days
7:18:20
out from this event and I would like to know those answers as well which is why
7:18:25
we are going through these investigations to be able to determine that fully okay um it's been reported
7:18:32
that the shooter was not carrying a driver's license or any form of
7:18:37
identification um they had no idea who he was but then he was quickly identified I think within 30 minutes by
7:18:45
using the serial number on the AR-15 um under a tracing system that is
7:18:52
now controversial some people say we should get rid of it some people want to keep it but is that right that the serial number was the key information
7:19:01
which led to the identification of the shooter that is my understanding sir yes
7:19:07
okay um if if an American citizen were just to
7:19:13
stop you and say director cheel we support your work to the tune of billions of dollars and thousands and
7:19:20
thousands of employees what went wrong what would you say again knowing that we're nine days
7:19:27
out I would say as I have said from the very outset I accept responsibility for this tragedy uh we are going to look
7:19:35
into how this happened and we are going to take corrective action to ensure that it never happens again well I appreciate
7:19:43
that um and and I hope you will act with Vigor and focus and intensity and it
7:19:48
seems you understand the the gravity and solemnity of this to the American people um millions and millions of Americans
7:19:54
don't feel safe with all the AR-15s out there we thought at least the president of the United States or a former president of the United States would be
7:20:00
safe but now that's not even clear Mr chairman I yield back to you gentlemen years back chair I recognize chairman of
7:20:06
the house Judiciary Committee Mr Jordan from Ohio thank you Mr chairman director were you guessing or
7:20:11
lying the day after president Trump is shot Secret Service spokesman Anthony gami said quote the assertion that a
7:20:18
member of the former president's security team requested additional security resources that the US Secret
7:20:24
Service or the Department of Homeland Security rebuffed is absolutely false the next day secretary my orcus said
7:20:30
said that is an unequivocally false assertion we had not received any request for additional security measures
7:20:36
that were rebuffed but five days later The Washington Post said this top
7:20:42
officials repeatedly rejected requests from Donald Trump's security detail for more Personnel the next day the New York
7:20:50
Times said this Mr gami acknowledged that the Secret Service had turned down some request for additional Federal
7:20:57
Security assets for Mr Trump's detail so which is it because both statements can't be true were you guessing or lying
7:21:04
when you said you didn't turn down requests from president Trump's
7:21:09
detail neither sir and I appreciate the question what what were you doing because those statements don't don't
7:21:16
Jive so what I can tell you is that for the event in Butler there were no
7:21:21
requests that were denied as far as requests well maybe they got tired of asking maybe you turned them down so
7:21:28
darn much they said not worth asking how many times did you turn him down ahead of that I think that it is important to
7:21:35
distinguish between what some people may view as a denial uh of an asset or a
7:21:41
request was Mr gami your spokesperson he said he acknowledge the
7:21:47
Secret Service had turned down some requests I'm asking how many a denial of a request does not equal a vulnerability
7:21:55
well tell me what it is there are a number of ways that threats and risks can be mitigated mitigated with a number
7:22:02
of different assets whether that be through Personnel whether that be through technology or other resour well
7:22:09
tell the committee which it was they asked for additional help in some form or another you told them no how many
7:22:16
times did you tell them no and what did you tell them no to again I cannot speak to specific
7:22:23
incidents but I can tell you in general terms uh the Secret Service uh is
7:22:28
judicious with their resources based on what does some requests mean how many times some indicate requests is plural
7:22:35
so more than once they asked for additional help and you turned them down what they ask for and how many times did you turn them down pretty basic
7:22:42
questions so again without having all of the details in front of me sir what I can tell you is that there are times you
7:22:48
didn't get briefed on how many times you turned down the Trump detail when they asked for additional help I'm I'm sorry you didn't get briefed on that before
7:22:54
you came to this hearing knowing you were going to get asked that question what I can tell you is that in generic
7:22:59
terms when people when when details make a request there are times that there are
7:23:05
alternate ways to cover off on that threat or that risk that's not what he said he said they were denied certain
7:23:11
request some request this is your spokesperson not me talking this is the Secret Service talking and it what a
7:23:17
change from absolutely false unequivocally false to oh by the way there were some times where we didn't
7:23:23
give them what they wanted that's a huge change in five days and the fact that you can't answer how many times you did
7:23:29
that that's pretty darn frustrating not just for me but for for the country I hear your frustration let me
7:23:36
ask you this were any of those request denied to president Trump's detail after you knew about the Iranian
7:23:42
threat what I can tell you again I don't know the specifics is that there are times when we can fill a request it
7:23:51
doesn't necessarily have to be with a Secret Service uh asset or resource we
7:23:56
can fill that request with locally available assets anyone at the White House since July
7:24:02
13th yes I have who'd you talk to I have briefed the president and the vice president talked to the first lady no I
7:24:09
have not talked to the White House staff anyone in White House communications no I have not have you
7:24:15
talked to the counter sniper who took the shot that took out the bad guy yes I have and can you tell us about that
7:24:21
conversation I would not want to reveal conversations that I've had with my employees but that's exactly the kind of
7:24:27
information the American people want to know American people who pay your salary I understand this is an ongoing
7:24:32
investigation and I who's all doing the investigating at Secret Service I know the Inspector General but is there also an internal investigation in addition to
7:24:38
the Inspector General we are conducting a mission Assurance investigation internally yes you know what it looks
7:24:45
like director looks like you won't answer some pretty basic questions it looks like you got a 9% raise and you cut Corners when it came to protecting
7:24:50
one of the most important individuals most well-known individuals on the planet a former president likely the guy's going to be the next president
7:24:57
looks like you guys were cutting Corners that's what it looks like to me is that true I am here today because I want to answer
7:25:02
questions but I also want to be CAU you might want to but you haven't answered I don't think you've answered one question from the chairman the ranking member or
7:25:10
me we got a lot of other people asking we'll see if your if your record improves but right now you haven't answered I don't think any questions all
7:25:16
you back gentlemen y back chair I recogniz miss Norton from Washington
7:25:21
DC thank you Mr chairman um in the summer of 1963 as a law student I
7:25:28
traveled to the South to work in the Civil Rights Movement when I arrived in Jackson Mississippi I was met by a civil
7:25:36
rights activist who showed me around town and tried to convince me to work in Jackson that summer I recall talking
7:25:43
with him and his wife about the raw at atmosphere in Jackson later that day he
7:25:49
took me to the bus station for my trip to my assignment that night he was
7:25:56
assassinated outside his home his name was megar ever I condemn the political violence it is a
7:26:04
threat to democracy I want to discuss one of the roots of political violence
7:26:09
guns for years Republicans including a member of this committee have introduced
7:26:14
legislation and amendments to repeal or block the District of Colombia gun
7:26:20
violence protection laws including its bans on assault weapons and large
7:26:25
capacity magazines the shooter at the Trump rally
7:26:31
use the mass Shooters gun of choice an assault weapon specifically an
7:26:38
ar5 style wet rifle and presumably a large capacity magazine which is defined
7:26:46
in DC as a magazine that can hold more than 10 bullets under current DC law DC
7:26:56
does not recognize Concealed Carry Permits issued by theur jurisdictions
7:27:01
but it does uh issue Concealed Carry Permits to both residents and
7:27:08
non-residents however DC imposes a number of requirements on concealed carry
7:27:14
applicants including suitability such as not having exhibited a propensity for
7:27:21
violence or instability moreover DC residence where where the uh restricts
7:27:28
where the guns can be carried such as a political demonstration near
7:27:33
the White House and Naval Observatory or near people under Secret Service
7:27:39
protection provided the permit holder has been given notice this week the
7:27:46
house is expected expected to consider the fiscal year 2025 financial services
7:27:53
and general government Appropriations Bill uh this Republican drafted bill
7:27:59
would allow an individual with a permit to carry a concealed
7:28:06
handgun issued by a state or territory uh to carry a concealed
7:28:14
handgun n DC regardless of that jurisdiction's
7:28:19
permit requirements a republican has filed an amendment to that provision to
7:28:26
allow such an individual to carry a magazine of any size with that handgun
7:28:33
in short the pending Bill and Amendment would allow any person with a carry
7:28:39
permit issued by another jurisdiction to carry a concealed handgun with a
7:28:45
magazine of any size in any location in
7:28:51
the District of Columbia the Secret Service is responsible for protecting a large number of people and facilities in
7:28:58
DC director Dr CH chel uh would Secret
7:29:03
Service protect his NDC be safer or less safe if people who have exhibited a
7:29:12
propensity for violence or instability could carry a concealed uh concealed
7:29:18
handguns NDC I think being a secret service agent
7:29:25
and an officer or a law enforcement officer in any state is difficult ult
7:29:30
they are required to make decisions and snap judgments uh in the blink of an eye
7:29:36
and I think that the officers and the Agents that work here in the DC area do a great job of monitoring uh the public
7:29:46
and reacting to threats as appropriate when they uh
7:29:51
arise would would would SE Secret Service protes in DC be safer or less
7:29:57
safe if people in DC could carry concealed handguns with
7:30:03
large capacity magazines I think ma'am that we work in
7:30:08
parameters where we travel around North America and the rules on open carry and
7:30:14
concealed carry are different from state to state and that is part of what the Secret Service takes into account when
7:30:20
we develop a security plan obviously anyone that comes into one of our protective sites we would establish
7:30:28
magnetometer support metal Det protectors that Personnel would have to process through eliminating that
7:30:34
potential uh would Secret Service protees in DC be safer or less safe if
7:30:40
more people could carry handguns uh in DC I think again as I stated ma'am we
7:30:46
want to make sure that we provide a safe environment for all of our protectees and whatever measures we would need to
7:30:52
put in place uh for a secure site we would do so I back G ladies times
7:30:58
expired chair I recognize that the the chairman of the house intelligence committee Mr Turner from Ohio director
7:31:04
cheel your opening statement indicates that the Secret Service constructed a security plan for the site in in Pennsylvania I'm assuming that security
7:31:10
plan would also include the security footprint for the site but it also would be based upon a threat assessment for
7:31:17
the risk threats associated with Donald Trump and the crowd attendance would it not include a threat assessment yes it
7:31:24
would so that threat assessment as we know um basically would have started with the a generalized threat against
7:31:31
Donald Trump because he is a presidential candidate then it would have gone to he's a former president and he gets uh security coverage just as
7:31:38
Bush Clinton Carter Obama do and then you also have the heightened political environment even for those it's clear
7:31:44
that the security footprint that the threat assessment was insufficient which permitted that a 20-year-old to actually
7:31:51
enter with the weapon and shoot Donald Trump but I want to ask you about two other aspects of the threat
7:31:57
assessment it is known and public that Iran is a threat risk for Donald Trump
7:32:03
they're a threat risk for John Bolton former Secretary of State Pompeo and Donald Trump because they have indicated
7:32:09
they want to assassinate them as a result of retaliation for the killing of
7:32:15
salomani that is both for Iran a generalized threat they're targeting these individuals but also most recently
7:32:21
a specific threat to Donald Trump himself now I want to uh enter into the
7:32:27
record by UC um a Department of Justice public affairs release a CNN article a
7:32:34
um an article from Fox News and an article from CBS all of which
7:32:39
acknowledge objection to order that this threat exists for Donald Trump from Iran
7:32:45
and that there are specific threats most recently that have been acknowledged director Cheeto have you
7:32:51
read the intelligence of the journalized threat to Donald Trump by Iran as a
7:32:57
result of their desire to retaliate for The Killing Salon excuse me Salomon I
7:33:04
have um have you read or been briefed about the intelligence of the specific
7:33:10
recent threat to Donald Trump from Iran yes I have director Ray when we were
7:33:16
getting our briefing indicated that he thought the threat assessment should have included this threat from Iran is
7:33:24
it your testimony today that the threat assessment since you've read this intelligence was sufficient to protect
7:33:30
him from this threat from Iran my testimony today is that the
7:33:37
information that we had at the time was known uh that was it sufficient director
7:33:42
cheel was it sufficient for the Iranian threat that you said you have read the intelligence briefings for that
7:33:49
information was passed to well I'm not asking the bureaucratic issue of who did it get passed around to director cheel
7:33:57
was it sufficient for the specific and generalized threat to Donald Trump's life from
7:34:02
Iran yes I do believe it was director cheel is an Iranian assassin more
7:34:09
capable than a 20-year-old sir I think we've acknowledged that there was gaps and a
7:34:15
failure that day when I raised this issue with director Ray he was incensed he he was shocked that the threat
7:34:22
assessment of Iran did not seem to be as we and I discussed baked in to your
7:34:27
security footprint and your threat assessment and he went on to say that the generalized threat that he has told
7:34:33
the whole country that we are under from a terrorist a potential terrorist threat he has said we're under the highest
7:34:39
Threat Level since 911 that the lights are flashing red and he has specifically indicated that people have crossed the
7:34:45
southern border as a result of the Biden administration's policy and that there are in our country today terrorists and
7:34:53
individuals who are affiliated with terrorist groups and organizations that would be a heightened threat environment
7:34:59
director chief would it not yes in his public statements he has said he is making these statements
7:35:06
because he wants people to take them into consideration in threat assessments
7:35:11
specifically now that would be a threat not just to Donald Trump but it would also be a threat to the crowd there
7:35:17
wouldn't it yes are Isis terrorists and Al-Qaeda terrorists and international
7:35:24
groups and terrorists more capable than a 20-year-old in pulling off their mass shooting or or an assassination of
7:35:30
Donald Trump sir again there was clearly a breakdown and a failure that day have
7:35:36
you read the intelligence of the terrorists that are currently in the United States that director Ray speaks
7:35:41
and those individuals that are here that are affiliated with terrorist groups and organizations that are in the processes director Bray said of representing a
7:35:49
significant threat of a terrorist attack occurring in the United States I have read reports that apply specifically to
7:35:56
the secret Services Mission Dr Cheeto because Donald Trump
7:36:01
is alive and thank God he is you look incompetent if Donald Trump had been killed you would have looked culpable
7:36:08
there is no aspect of this that indicates that there has been any protection to Donald Trump the threat
7:36:14
was was identified before he took St the stage and the shooter was only killed
7:36:19
after Donald Trump himself was killed not only should you resign if you refuse to do so President Biden needs to fire
7:36:25
you because his life Donald Trump's life and all the other people which you protect are at risk because you have no
7:36:32
concept of the aspect that the security footprint needs to be correlated to the threat I go back chair now recognize Mr
7:36:40
Lynch from Massachusetts thank you Mr chairman uh director cheel there were
7:36:45
multiple security failures at the former president's rally in in Butler
7:36:51
Pennsylvania first of all there was a failure to isolate the podium
7:36:56
from exposure to direct fire do we know who M who made that decision
7:37:04
to to allow that rooftop to remain as a
7:37:10
an unprotected area do we know who came up with that security plan that that uh
7:37:15
omitted that sir I don't have uh a specific
7:37:20
person to identify for you okay well that's what I'm looking for so let's let's move on uh there's also breakdown
7:37:26
in Security in Failure to confront the SHO uh over an hour before the former
7:37:32
president began his remarks when the shooter was identified as a person of
7:37:37
interest um what particularly allowed agents or or law
7:37:45
enforcement to identify him as a person of interest so I appreciate the question
7:37:50
and again I will say that we are nine days out and there are multitude of interviews that are still taking place
7:37:56
okay so did he have a rangefinder was some reports that that the individual
7:38:01
had a rangefinder that would that would certainly raise my suspicion uh did he have a range
7:38:08
finder yes he did but may I explain that at a number of our sites especially when
7:38:14
you're at outdoor venues uh a rangefinder is not a prohibited item it is sometimes an item that is brought in
7:38:20
by individuals if you're going to be did anybody anybody confront them on that anybody ask him questions what are you
7:38:26
doing with the rangefinder anybody confront him on on his presence where
7:38:32
where he was in proximity to the president so again to my knowledge I believe that that was the process that
7:38:37
was taking place was to locate the individual did they did they confront him did they go up to him did they talk
7:38:43
to him I do not have those details at this time those are important details
7:38:50
uh it was also a failure to communicate between law enforcement to act quickly
7:38:55
uh upon information provided by either local law enforcement or rally attendees
7:39:01
that the suspect was positioned on the roof there were minutes of delay uh
7:39:07
before um any any meaningful action was taken even though he was several hundred
7:39:12
feet from the podium and uh this was obviously minutes before the the shooting
7:39:20
um let me ask you there was considerable delay in removing the president uh from the podium after the
7:39:28
shooting began he shot in the air it was still a over a minute before he was
7:39:33
removed from the stage meanwhile this Shooter had multiple clips several Clips
7:39:40
he got off eight shots and he had the capacity and the ability if he was not
7:39:46
neutralized to to basically mold down that whole Secret Service Detachment as
7:39:53
well as the president um what from your own
7:40:00
investigation uh caused that that delay under the circumstances what I can tell you is
7:40:07
that when the agents uh identified that the shooting was taking place in under
7:40:12
three seconds they threw themselves on top I understand that there was heroism
7:40:17
there no question about it no question about it but protocol would indicate and
7:40:23
these are you know these are uh the the the opinions of various former Secret
7:40:29
Service agents people who have uh done this work in the past that over a minute
7:40:35
of exposure on that Podium with with a a
7:40:40
shooter with a high-capacity weapon who had already wounded the president and
7:40:46
and and could have got off we don't know how many more rounds um and yet the
7:40:53
president remained exposed even though he was joined in that exposure by the
7:40:58
Secret Service in their heroic acts it just uh it I
7:41:04
don't know if there's a good explanation for that our personel created a body bunker on top of the president I get
7:41:10
shielding him yeah this was this was an AR-15 uh style weapon that would have
7:41:16
made pretty quick work if if he was determined and able to do so this is not
7:41:21
the first investigation that we've had of the secet service during my time here on this committee and the last one we
7:41:26
had uh our previous investigation determined that the Secret Service was
7:41:32
experienced a staffing crisis that poses perhaps the greatest threat to the agency and that's a quote is that
7:41:39
Staffing crisis still in place is that still something that you deal with on a daily basis as of today
7:41:46
the secret service has just over 8,000 employees we continue to hire uh knowing
7:41:51
that we need to ensure that we keep Pace with what would be the full complement of of and gentlemen time expired but
7:41:58
please answer the question yeah I'm sorry what would be the full compliment that you're looking for
7:42:03
you've got 8,000 and how many how many would be a full compliment for for the service so we are we are still striving
7:42:10
towards a number of 95 uh 100 employees approximately in order to be able to
7:42:15
meet future and emerging needs okay thank you Mr chairman for your courtesy I yield back chair recognizes Dr Fox
7:42:21
from North Carolina thank you Mr chairman director cheel what grade would
7:42:26
you give the secret Services performance in Butler Pennsylvania on July
7:42:34
13th as I've stated ma'am this was clearly a failure I would grade the
7:42:40
agents and officers who selflessly threw themselves in front of the president and neutralize the threat and a I think that
7:42:48
we need to examine the events that led up to uh and prior to that
7:42:54
day you stated in 2021 that the secret service has a zero fail Mission it's
7:43:01
clear that the events of July 13 show a Cascade of failures that caused Corey
7:43:06
comparator his life nearly cost former president his life and injured David
7:43:12
Dutch and James copenhaver when an agency fails spectacularly at its
7:43:18
Mission those responsible must be held accountable and the problems must be
7:43:23
fixed so they cannot happen again why should the American people or the officials your responsible for
7:43:29
protecting have confidence in your ability to lead the Secret Service after
7:43:34
such a spectacular failure I appreciate the question and I am committed to
7:43:40
finding answers so that we can make the agency stronger after this you said on
7:43:45
July 15 that the buck stops with me how are you taking accountability for the
7:43:50
secret Services failures during the July 13 assassination attempt on President
7:43:56
Trump I have taken accountability and I will continue to take accountability I am responsible for leading the agency
7:44:03
and I am responsible for finding the answers to how this event occurred and making sure that it doesn't happen again
7:44:11
so I would like to explore how you got the job as director of the United States
7:44:17
Secret Service is it typical for the director of The Secret Service to be recommended
7:44:23
for the role at the behest of a president's family and Senior staff perhaps at the reest of Joe Biden or
7:44:30
Anthony Bernal I got the job as a director of The Secret Service because I spent 27
7:44:37
years in an agency with a mission that I absolutely love I started my career in
7:44:42
Detroit I worked my way up through investigations and protection were you
7:44:47
was there competition for the position you would have to ask those who
7:44:52
were involved in the interview process uh but you think you are the
7:44:58
best person person in the country to head the Secret Service I think that I am the best
7:45:04
person to lead the secret service at this time the Secret Service receives
7:45:09
billions in funding each year as has been explained by my colleagues here in
7:45:15
fact the incre you've had an increase in real terms of
7:45:21
55% as you're no doubt aware Staffing levels for those assigned to protect the
7:45:26
president former presidents and other senior officials has decreased by about
7:45:33
350 between 2014 and today clearly a lack of Financial Resources not to blame
7:45:40
for the staffing shortage in 2022 the Secret Service saw nearly half
7:45:45
its Workforce leave in one year during the same year it was ranked dead last
7:45:50
among law enforcement agencies in the best places to work in the federal government can you explain why your
7:45:56
agency was so poorly rated and why so many staff left in just one
7:46:02
year so with all due respect I uh dispute the the statistic of half of the
7:46:09
employees leaving uh in 2022 I think that that has been inaccurate data that's been reported out there but what
7:46:15
I can tell you is as I have returned as the Director of the agency we have had an increase in hiring and Staffing and
7:46:21
an increase in resources and we are committed to continue to hire uh so that
7:46:27
we can be staffed appropriate to meet the dynamic mission that we have well
7:46:34
you may want to dispute it but it's out there my understand given the
7:46:39
high-profile high-profile failures and rotten culture at the Secret Service
7:46:45
during your nearly two-year turn tenure why should the American people have any
7:46:50
confidence in your ability to lead the Secret Service to perform its zero fail
7:46:56
mission to protect our senior leaders the secret service has an incredible
7:47:01
culture our men and women Place service over self they come in every day willing
7:47:07
to risk their lives for our protective Mission and they work investigations that uh thwart people who
7:47:14
would do harm to children uh child exploiters we have an incredible Mission and our culture is we will get the job
7:47:21
done no matter what well those on the front lines certainly have a great culture and they were willing to risk
7:47:27
their lives for president Trump TR but I'm not sure the leadership at the
7:47:32
agency has this right kind of culture I yield back Mr chairman chair now recogniz Mr Conley from Virginia thank
7:47:39
you Mr chairman well I hope the American people do
7:47:44
appreciate the incredible daily risks Secret Service agents take on our behalf
7:47:52
you mentioned there are 36 regular client you've got that you protect
7:47:58
constantly but I was participating in the NATO Summit just two weeks ago we had 32
7:48:04
heads of government and heads of state plus visiting heads of state and heads of government presumably you provided
7:48:10
protection for all of them that is correct just just saying
7:48:16
um help us understand however I I I I will stipulate that there there's
7:48:22
ongoing investigation you don't want to go into too much detail on that until you've been able to ascertain all the
7:48:28
facts and analyze what they mean you can understand however the anxiety we and
7:48:34
the American public have about how could this happen and how can we ensure it can't
7:48:42
recur now there are some things my friends uh uh on one particular side of
7:48:47
the aisle don't really want to talk about like AR-15s and access to them by
7:48:53
a 20-year-old or anybody for that matter presumably uh director cheel the
7:49:01
ubiquity of weapons guns in America especially assault weapons or
7:49:07
semi-automatic weapons that's helped your job and the mission of your agencies right it's it's made it less
7:49:14
complicated isn't that true I'm sorry I'm not understanding your question real simple more guns
7:49:21
especially Dangerous Ones have made your job protecting people easier is that not
7:49:26
right I think at uh from every director
7:49:32
cheetah this is simple English more guns are do they make your job more
7:49:38
complicated or less complicated in protecting these 36 clients and visiting
7:49:44
heads of state and heads of government that come to Washington I think the Secret Service needs to take into
7:49:49
account I didn't ask that they I'm I'm sorry I asked simple question which
7:49:54
deserves a simple answer the iquity of guns dangerous weapons in America like
7:50:02
AR-15s has that made your job that is to say the mission of the Secret Service easier or more difficult I think the
7:50:09
threat environment for protecting our uh Secret Service uh protectees is always
7:50:15
difficult and that's Dynamic and it's always evolving we stipulate it's always difficult I again this is a simple
7:50:24
one do does the ubiquity of guns make your job easier or more difficult
7:50:31
today I understand the Second Amendment rights of individual I didn't ask that question I'm not questioning the Second
7:50:37
Amendment I'm asking a simple analysis director cheel and I can tell you you're
7:50:43
not making my job easier in terms of assessing your qualification for
7:50:48
continuing on as director please answer the question you're the head of the Secret Service
7:50:55
you're speaking on behalf of 8,000 members who put their lives on the line we just had a failure by your own
7:51:01
admission do guns make your job easier or harder I think the job of the Secret
7:51:07
Service is difficult on every day and we need to make sure that we are mitigating all threats whether that be isn't my
7:51:15
question that is not my question and now I think you're evading the answer which
7:51:20
is not a hard one I am sorry that you feel that way sir H how else could I feel director
7:51:27
cheel when you're clearly avoiding a direct answer to a very simple declarative
7:51:33
question we almost lost a presidential candidate the other day a 20-year-old
7:51:40
had access to his father's AR-15 and got on top of a roof within 500 yards or
7:51:46
feet of the podium and I'm asking you did the
7:51:51
availability of that AR-15 which is replicated all across America make your
7:51:56
job harder or easier and you're not willing to answer that question and you think and and you wonder why we might
7:52:03
have a lack of confidence in your continued ability to direct this agency
7:52:08
I understand your question and that's the environment well if you understand my question why not answer it because
7:52:13
it's the environment that the Secret Service Works in every day that that doesn't tell me anything
7:52:19
that's the that's the environment we work in I had an I had an attack on my office
7:52:27
a year ago I know a little a little bit about violence too he came to kill me when he couldn't
7:52:35
he beat one of my staffords eight times with a baseball bat on the head we live
7:52:41
with the threat of violence but a simple answer from the director of The Secret Service would be
7:52:47
helpful and I'm sorry you've chosen to evade it I yeld back chair now recognize Mr grofman from
7:52:56
Wisconsin thank you um when this guy uh took the shots he
7:53:02
climbed a ladder to get on the roof correct I'm unable to answer details of
7:53:07
exactly how the individual access the roof at this time do you know when they uh if he did
7:53:15
use the ladder do you know when the ladder was placed there was the ladder there two days before just the night
7:53:20
before do you have any information at all as to when the ladder got there I would like to be able to answer those
7:53:26
questions the FBI is still cond conducting an investigation how did the rifle get to
7:53:32
the to the roof again sir at this time on unable to answer questions to provide have they
7:53:39
cleaned the roof since the since the assassination
7:53:44
attempt have they cleaned the roof right has anything been done to the roof is it just like it was you know whatever 10
7:53:51
days ago or or or not has anything been done to the roof I I don't have an answer for
7:53:58
that okay um were president Trump's normal
7:54:03
agents normally assigned to him there that day
7:54:08
yes there was no these were the same agents that were always there yes sir the people that are
7:54:15
assigned to his detail were working on that day okay there there's stuff on the
7:54:20
internet that says they were not there that day but these are the same agents who are routinely there yes sir okay
7:54:29
uh do we know which agents fired the shots that finally took down the potential
7:54:35
assassin yes sir I do can you give us those names or background of those
7:54:40
agents I would not uh offer their name up in this setting but it was one of our
7:54:45
technical uh officers or counter snipers okay so can we privately get those names
7:54:51
the committee I I am certain that we can make names available privately okay um
7:54:58
do we know where all the shots landed how first of all how many shots
7:55:04
did did the potential assassin how many shots uh came out of the rifle so again
7:55:09
I would hesitate to offer that information as the FBI is conducting an
7:55:14
investigation have we got the bullets from all the shots again that would be the responsibility of the FBI to collect
7:55:21
that evidence okay um do we have any
7:55:29
do we have the correspondence um from the shooter has
7:55:35
that been recovered from his phone whatever again I would have to defer you to the FBI for details on that
7:55:42
investigation okay um you've spent some time uh trying to
7:55:50
change the makeup of the Secret Service okay you feel there whatever too high a
7:55:56
percentage are men um does this affect at all uh who you
7:56:03
are hiring for the Secret Service I've spent my time as the Director trying to increase the number
7:56:11
of people that we hire in the Secret Service so that we have the best and the brightest and that's been my
7:56:17
concentration as the Director okay you ever hiring uh
7:56:24
hiring not hiring men because of your desire to hit certain targets
7:56:29
I am hiring the best qualified candidates that put in an application that want to work for our great
7:56:37
organization okay um next next question uh the shooter
7:56:45
obtained a direct sight of of President Trump from from uh the position on the
7:56:51
rooftop I assume that is not something that should ever happen it should never happen do you want to elaborate a little
7:56:57
on how that happened or what you wish you had done differently or would do differently next time there's a trump
7:57:04
rally again sir the facts of this uh particular event are still unfolding uh
7:57:11
nine days there have been a number of reports that have been out there so I do not want to provide an in information
7:57:17
that perhaps would contradict something that has been erroneously reported or uh
7:57:22
is not factual but there clearly was a mistake and we will take every effort to make sure that this never happens again
7:57:30
could you elaborate why you want onethird of the uh uh Secret Service to be
7:57:37
women I've never stated that I want onethird of the Secret Service to be women 30% or something you had some
7:57:43
Target no um okay would J yield sure I'll yield
7:57:50
what was director what was erroneously reported you said to Mr Gran's question you said something was erroneously
7:57:55
reported what are you referring to I'm referring to his question was in in the context of the shooter using a ladder to
7:58:01
get on the building what was erroneously reported because you won't tell us anything but you'll tell us something that wasn't reported accurately I'm
7:58:08
saying sir that there have been a number of reports that are out there that have been speculation and until we have the
7:58:14
actual facts I don't want to report anything that would contradict uh speculation that has been out there
7:58:22
thank gentleman for healing chair recognize Mr Chris morte from Illinois thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
7:58:28
ranking member for bringing us together this morning one question I get asked a lot from my constituents is what can
7:58:34
Congress actually do to stop this from happening again and I'd like to share a graphic from a very recent study
7:58:41
conducted by Professor Robert Pape a world-renowned expert in combating political violence the graphic shows
7:58:48
that 74% of Americans want this Congress to come together to denounce political
7:58:54
violence of all stripes and you can tell it's a cross party lines
7:58:59
um I commend the chair and ranking member for putting out the statement the other day condemning political violence
7:59:05
and to further this effort um I'd like to ask all my colleagues to join Dr Brad wstr and me in introducing a resolution
7:59:13
that we think can secure unanimous house passage in deploring and condemning political violence and we will be
7:59:19
circulating that resolution shortly director
7:59:25
cheel as you know the shooter be began shooting at 6:11 p.m. Eastern on July
7:59:31
13th NBC reported that at 5:51 p.m. 20 minutes before the shooting began the
7:59:37
state police informed the Secret Service of their concern now the rally was not paused at that point
7:59:43
correct no and according to NBC just 2 minutes later at 5:53 p.m. the Secret
7:59:50
Service notified its snipers about the gunman the rally wasn't paused at that
7:59:56
point either correct no let me show you some video footage by rally goers if you could play the video
8:00:04
on the screen up here this was taken two minutes before
8:00:12
the shooting start if you could turn up the volume criminal we have
8:00:20
criminal we have people on the
8:00:26
roof on the here ma'am that doesn't look like
8:00:31
suspicious behavior that looks like threatening behavior to me and the rally wasn't pause at that point either
8:00:37
correct I can tell you as I stated earlier sir that the moment that the shift uh surrounding the president were
8:00:45
aware of an actual threat that's a threat right there the guy's on the roof
8:00:50
and everybody's yelling at him yes and and directing the officer attention to him the rally was not paused at that
8:00:57
point correct we are currently still combing through Communications and when
8:01:02
Communications were passed well I can point you to this communication it's two minutes before the shots started ringing
8:01:08
Out director cheel yes or no was there ever a moment where the Secret Service
8:01:13
actually considered pausing the rally the Secret Service would have paused the rally had they known or been
8:01:21
so the answer is no an actual threat the answer is no correct I can I can speak to you in
8:01:29
generalities no no I don't want generalities I want specifications the answer is no you did not consider
8:01:34
pausing the rally correct the people that are in charge of protecting the president on that day would never bring
8:01:41
the former president out if there was a threat that had been identified well they did because we've now identified
8:01:49
three points in the in the 20 minutes before the shooting that the threat emerged let me point you to something
8:01:56
else uh which is the building that the shooter was perched on seen here this building is called the AGR building I'm
8:02:04
sure that you're familiar with it um it's no more than 150 yards from the stage where Donald Trump stood yet the
8:02:11
security perimeter was drawn such that the AGR building was placed outside of IT director cheel according to the
8:02:18
Washington Post the AR AR-15 styled rifle used in the shooting had had a
8:02:23
range of 400 to 600 yards and therefore the AGR building is was clearly within
8:02:30
rifle range of the stage correct yes NBC News has reported that
8:02:36
in the days before the rally the Secret Service had identified the building as a vulnerability that required special
8:02:41
attention correct that's reporting from NBC yes so
8:02:48
I am still looking into an active investigation I know but it's been nine days I mean you you should you should
8:02:53
know that right and yet despite the fact that the AGR building was in rifle range
8:02:58
of the stage and it was flagged as a vulnerability this building was put outside of the secret Services security
8:03:05
perimeter and I I I respectfully submit the security Secret Service must expand
8:03:11
its security perimeter to account for the kinds of weapons that can be used outside the perimeter to endanger the
8:03:18
protectees inside the perimeter ma'am let me turn your attention to some
8:03:24
conspiracy theories that have been uh circulating and ask you to uh comment on them first you have not
8:03:32
found evidence that the incident was a stage shooting right correct and you haven't found evidence that this was a
8:03:38
result of a conspiracy of high ranking government officials correct correct and you have not found evidence that this
8:03:43
incident was in fact directed or perpetrated by a foreign state or entity right and and that's the last question
8:03:49
but I'll let the director answer that please not at this time thank you I yield back gentleman's time's expired
8:03:54
chair I recognize Mr cloud from Texas uh thank than I just wanted to confirm there was only one counter sniper who
8:04:00
took one shot is that we had multiple counter sniper teams Avail yeah on the
8:04:07
premises but is is only one took one shot is that correct or only one correct okay um how many spint shell casings
8:04:15
were found on the roof again I would have to defer you to the FBI's criminal investigation okay
8:04:21
word is is that the car was roted with explosives again sir I'd have to defer you to the FBI's investigation
8:04:29
okay you're you're not curious about you don't communicate with them no okay uh CNN reported that the
8:04:38
Secret Service did not sweep the building the shooter was used to shoot president Trump and other attendees is that true or false so we are conducting
8:04:46
a mission Insurance investigation and will'll depend on the information that we obtain from our investigations okay
8:04:54
um secret service knew there was a suspicious person anywhere from 8 minutes minutes before President walked on stage to 30 to 60 minutes with
8:05:01
different reports was President Trump or his team notified of the threat I think there's a difference and
8:05:07
a distinction between suspicious suspicious person and threat yeah so uh we are going back and looking at
8:05:13
communications to know when the information about a suspicious person was passed to Secret Service
8:05:21
Personnel okay but was President Trump or his team notified again we are going
8:05:26
back and looking to to make sure that we have the exact information of when those notifications were made and who those
8:05:33
notifications were made to okay it I think it's troubling for a lot of us that the number one question everyone in
8:05:39
America is wondering is why was the roof left open and after nine days we should at least maybe have a little bit of that
8:05:46
information and when you come to this Committee hearing and you don't have anything to say about that it's it's
8:05:53
very very troubling um did you review the security plan for this event
8:05:58
I personally do not review security plans for events that take place across
8:06:03
the country any of them we have a number of events who's
8:06:10
the top level official who re reviews the security plans there there's a number of people that review security
8:06:17
plans who's ultimately responsible for signing off on a security plan it it's a
8:06:22
conjunction of personnel uh there are people on the ground there are supervisors on the detail there are people at headquarters so there's not
8:06:29
one person who says okay this is good it's copesthetic we're going for it
8:06:34
I think much in the way that we build our security plans where they are multi there's teams working different aspects
8:06:39
of it but ultimately isn't there an individual who signs off on the plan much like how we design our security
8:06:46
plans they're multi-layered there are multiple layers so there's no accountability there is accountability
8:06:51
sir there's this is this is whe whether it's the FBI or fouchy or or any It's
8:06:58
Time After Time After Time these multiple layers of accountability turn
8:07:03
into layers of plausible deniability in agency after agency after agency that's
8:07:08
got to be fixed because you keep coming here and expecting yes you're saying I'm responsible but and you're accountable
8:07:15
for it but then there's no there's nothing what do you mean by that I mean you're you're saying you're going to
8:07:20
keep your job right I assure you sir that if we determine through the course of our
8:07:26
investigation that someone or people need to be held accountable we will do
8:07:33
so what level of if President Biden God forbid had been shot and killed would
8:07:40
you think that was worthy of resignation I would do the same thing that I'm doing here where I would want
8:07:46
to make sure that we are conducting an investigation that there is continuity
8:07:52
in that investigation and that we could find the answers think assassination of somebody under DET under your details
8:07:58
worthy of resignation I think that this event was tragic and deserves answers the thing that you've said so
8:08:05
far is that you want to make sure that this never happens again the thing is everyone in America knows that's not the
8:08:11
job description that you're tasked with the job description you're task was is to make sure it never happens period um
8:08:18
one of your goals in the Strategic plan is to Champion diversity Equity inclusion and accessibility you've
8:08:24
accomplished the accessibility part um what standards do you keep the same
8:08:32
standards for all applicants and all or does every secret service agent meet the
8:08:38
same qualifications or do you have different standards for different people yes sir everyone who moves through the application process has to meet the same
8:08:45
standards to become a special agent okay the the trouble I think we're
8:08:51
having with right now so far you gave a lame excuse for sloped roof you said
8:08:56
that local law enforcement's job was to cover up the uh building before backtracking on that we were told that
8:09:03
President Trump's team did not ask for security before you backtracked on that you haven't provided the audio recording
8:09:09
that this committee the chairman s uh requested that was due Thursday um you
8:09:16
didn't give us Advanced copy of your opening statement but yet there was reporting on it somewhere else uh there
8:09:22
seems to be more information from YouTube videos than you're able to provide for us and it it begs the
8:09:27
question to anyone you're in charge of the investigation of your own failure so how is anybody in America supposed to be
8:09:33
able to trust the results of that investigation as being anything transparent and genuine that's
8:09:41
the last question but please feel free to answer the question director sir I've been a secret service agent for nearly 30 years I have led with integrity and I
8:09:49
follow our core values of Duty Justice honor loyalty and courage and I am doing
8:09:56
that in this case and I assure this committee that I will provide answers when we have a full and complete report
8:10:04
in addition to cooperating with all of the other investigations that are ongoing chair I recognize Mr Conor from
8:10:11
California thank you Mr chair I want to thank the chair and the ranking member for convening this hearing on a
8:10:17
bipartisan basis I join them in condemning the horrific assassination
8:10:25
attempt on the former president I am relieved for the sake of the country that he wasn't seriously hurt
8:10:32
and that he survived and my thoughts with him and his family during such a traumatic event I also want to express
8:10:40
condolences to Corey comor family and uh
8:10:45
recognize his heroism in Saving his uh daughter's lives and to the victims of
8:10:52
that awful event now director k
8:10:58
would you agree that this is the most serious security lapse since President Reagan was shot in 1981 of the Secret
8:11:05
Service yes sir I would and you know do you know what Stuart Knight did when he
8:11:11
was in charge at the time of the Secret Service you know what he did afterwards he remained on duty he resigned he
8:11:19
resigned and Stuart Knight was not a Democratic appointee or a republican
8:11:25
appointee look I'm not questioning your judgment I and I just don't think this is partisan if you have an assassination
8:11:33
attempt on a president former president or uh a candidate you need to resign
8:11:40
that's what Stuart Knight did he was a Republican appointee and he took responsibility and I I think you need to
8:11:47
reflect this is not a question of you it's a question of the American people you cannot go leading a Secret Service
8:11:54
Agency when there is an assassin ation attempt on a presidential candidate I
8:12:01
would I would say that about anyone who uh is running and so I guess my question
8:12:06
to you is what's the difference between your position and what Stewart Knight
8:12:12
did what I will tell you sir is that I am dedicated to finding the answers to what happened and like every secret
8:12:19
service agent we don't Sherk our responsibilities I will remain on and be
8:12:25
responsible to the agency to this committee to the former president and to the American public but is is there a
8:12:31
reason you wouldn't just do what stord Knight did after the Reagan uh assassination attempt I believe that I
8:12:38
provided an answer there's there's nothing more that you have to say I mean do you really believe at this moment given how divided
8:12:45
the country is and the questions asked that your service in this role is the
8:12:50
best for the nation I mean I I'm not saying you can't do public service again you can't do something else again do you really genuinely in your heart believe
8:12:57
that you being in this role is what's right for America at this moment I mean do you do you think there are people who
8:13:03
are Trump supporters who have confidence in you the one thing that the we've got to have agencies in this country that
8:13:09
are transcend politics that have the confidence of Independence Democrats Republicans progressives conservatives
8:13:15
do you really believe that the majority of this country has confidence in you right now I believe that the country
8:13:21
deserves answers and I am committed to finding those answers and providing those answers I
8:13:27
well look I believe director shidel that you should resign I think there are colleagues on both sides of the aisle
8:13:32
who believe that and I hope you'll consider it he
8:13:40
back chair now recognizes uh Mr Palmer
8:13:45
from Alabama for five minutes director cheel did local law enforcement uh ESU
8:13:50
teams have compromised authority to engage a perceived threat
8:13:57
yes uh why do you think they didn't use it I believe that they follow the same
8:14:02
use of force uh that are you don't when you have compromised Authority you don't have to get permission if you perceive a
8:14:10
threat and there were uh not just the ESU units but there were local law
8:14:15
enforcement that had line of sight on the shooter before the shots were taken
8:14:21
so one of my uh questions is is there was supposed to be a briefing with the
8:14:27
uh Secret Service sniper units your counter assault team members with the
8:14:33
contract team with the local ESU teams that didn't take place why was that so I
8:14:40
have been told that there has been a briefing there was a briefing that took place I've been told that there wasn't one and again we are still looking into
8:14:48
the facts of the investigation so let me ask you this uh when were you informed
8:14:54
that there was a credible threat against uh president Trump former president Trump when did you learn of that sir the
8:15:01
former president has a number of threats I I I didn't ask you that there was a credible threat from Iran when were you
8:15:08
informed of that answer the question we have been monitoring the threats you
8:15:13
knew before you knew before the rally okay all right uh the site security plan
8:15:21
is generally drafted by uh the site supervisor and the site agent
8:15:27
uh probably out of the Pittsburgh district office uh did they take into account the
8:15:33
credible threat against President trump our Personnel take into account the threats that are then why would they
8:15:39
leave a building and I will correct the distance that's been quoted it was about 140 yards with clear line of sight to
8:15:45
the president why was that building not occupied on the roof I mean you could have put Barney five on the roof and and
8:15:52
kept somebody from getting up there so why why wasn't that done
8:15:57
the plan that was developed that day encompassed a number of security mitigations the the issue is the site
8:16:06
supervisor the site agent and and the and the special agent in charge who Pro
8:16:12
I think signed off on the plan did not include that in the in the inner perimeter and they didn't have a plan to
8:16:19
secure the building the as I understand it the Butler County ESU unit was
8:16:25
situated on the second floor of an of a building next to that but they didn't have a clear line of side of the roof
8:16:31
the angle was too severe uh the photograph that was taken of the young man uh of the shooter when
8:16:38
he had the rangefinder was taken at 5:15 it wasn't until 538 that that photograph
8:16:45
was uh transmitted to the Secret Service sniper units I don't understand the lack
8:16:50
of interoperability here in the communication process I don't understand why uh people didn't perceive that is a
8:16:57
credible threat uh the video that Mr Christen morphe had shown there was clearly a credible
8:17:03
threat so how is it that all of these mistakes could be made how many
8:17:09
explosive devices were found on or near the site again I would have to defer you to
8:17:16
the FBI Madam I I I believe they were in his car and and there I think there
8:17:22
might have been one near a main gas line uh it wasn't just the fact that he
8:17:27
had a rifle it was the fact that he had the ability to inflict enormous harm
8:17:33
enormous numbers of casualties had those devices exploded
8:17:39
um I want to know also um when you when your agents
8:17:48
conduct a site review are they fully informed of all of the threats that are being made against
8:17:56
uh the the the principle that they're protecting what I can tell you is that
8:18:02
when our agents go out to conduct an advance their whole goal is to ensure
8:18:08
understand what their goal is the the failure to secure that building not only put the presid former president's life
8:18:14
in danger it put the the lives of individuals in the crowd in danger as well I mean the Reagan shooting there
8:18:20
were other people shot at that time as well uh and the secret service members
8:18:27
lives were in danger so I don't understand how you can continue to stay
8:18:35
in the position you're in when this was a a a failure of historic
8:18:44
magnitude 43 years without anything like this happening and and you failed in
8:18:50
this case in a spectacular way Mr chairman Yi back gentleman yields back
8:18:55
chair recognizes Mr mfum from Maryland thank you Mr chair I want to
8:19:01
commend you and the uh ranking member on your joint statement and for holding this hearing that we might all at least
8:19:08
attempt to try to get some answers some of us uh Miss cheel grew up in an era uh
8:19:15
not too unlike what we see today in terms of political violence and some of us remember the November 22nd 1963
8:19:24
assassination of President Kennedy uh some of us like myself remember two
8:19:29
days later when Jack Ruby on live TV shot and killed Lee Harvey Oswald we've
8:19:36
seen over and over and over since that time these kind of attempts whether it was the assassination of Martin Luther
8:19:42
King or Bobby Kennedy or the attempted attack on George Wallace in Laurel Maryland the shooting in 1981 of Ronald
8:19:50
Reagan our friend and colleague Steve S shooting here in DC and the unfortunate
8:19:57
attack on Paul Pelosi and now this matter regarding former president
8:20:03
Trump I I'm let me try if I might to take another walk at this people just assume
8:20:12
that whoever is in charge takes full responsibility when there's never been
8:20:18
at least on this magnitude and scale this sort of failure so when members ask
8:20:24
you are you going to resign and you say you have no intention to they are
8:20:30
perplexed like many people who watch what's going on and I there's some things I just
8:20:36
don't understand why was the building the ARG building placed outside of the
8:20:43
perimeter when clearly it was close enough for someone to launch an
8:20:48
attack so again sir we are looking into all of the details of how the advanced was comprised but I can tell you that
8:20:55
there was OverWatch on that building provided that day by a
8:21:00
drone I'm not going to get into the specifics of technology or assets that were used well I think it's fair to say
8:21:06
the OverWatch failed because the shooter got up on the roof and stayed there for a while and people had pointed him out
8:21:13
so do you think that your OverWatch was a failure in that case I think that we need to know the full details to
8:21:20
understand how this occurred and why was the rooftop left naked to begin with can
8:21:25
you tell us that consider considering it was within the line of sight and so very
8:21:31
close again I I can't speak to the specifics of this particular event site
8:21:37
but what I can tell you is that when the Secret Service develops an advanced plan
8:21:42
they take into account a number of uh factors when they're when they're building their Advance uh if there are
8:21:48
buildings or areas of concern and OverWatch is uh one of those mitigations
8:21:54
that they want to put in place then they will cover off areas of responsibility I understand that but the
8:22:01
shooter came to the attention of your agency 52 minutes before the former
8:22:06
president got to the stage did anybody get a signed to watch or cover that
8:22:11
individual who what already been seen with a uh Advanced finder on him and
8:22:18
other suspicious matters was anybody assigned to track him so what I'd like to clarify is that a suspicious
8:22:25
individual I got that part the attention of our personnel and again
8:22:31
having a rangefinder at an outdoor event well let me ask you this when the suspicious person was brought to the
8:22:38
attention of the Secret Service was anybody in the detail order to follow and stay with that suspicious person
8:22:46
just because they might become a threat so we have a number of teams that are on the ground uh and again we are trying to
8:22:53
verify the timelines of when those notifications were made to our Personnel so that they could uh assume the
8:22:59
responsibility of trying to track that individual Miss Cheeto there has been uh
8:23:04
a lot of discussion some of which raised itself earlier in this hearing about poor staff morale within your agency and
8:23:13
I have the July 17th report of uh government executive which is a credible
8:23:20
reporting service for the federal government for employees and the 2023
8:23:26
ranking of places to work within the federal government showed and this is through the office of personnel
8:23:33
management that the Secret Service came in 413th out of 459 sub agencies and
8:23:41
agencies can you explain that certainly what I can tell you is
8:23:46
the Secret Service is a difficult job it challenges our employees daily it's
8:23:52
holidays it's weekends it's no leave periods but Madam people come to work
8:23:59
knowing that you do explain that when you hire somebody they know that it's
8:24:04
the same with other agencies they they miss holidays they come to work at odd hours but to be wor one of the worst
8:24:11
places to work within the federal government 413 out of
8:24:17
459 I'm I just need an explanation what do you think as the Director there I
8:24:23
think that this and that's the last question but please answer Mr inu's Question I think that this is a challenging job I
8:24:28
think that it's a challenging environment to be in law enforcement and we do have a no fail Mission and our
8:24:34
folks are tasked with that every day 365 days of the year but I can tell you I've
8:24:39
also taken a number of measures since I've been the director to recruit and retain and stem the tide of attrition in
8:24:46
our agency which will hopefully alleviate some of that thank you Mr chairman uh chair now recognize Mr
8:24:52
sessions from Texas Mr chairman thank you very much I join in and the the calls of both all of our members to say
8:24:58
thank you for doing this hearing on a bipartisan basis director I'm not going to sit here
8:25:06
and say you ought to resign but I am going to say that you have not given us confidence that you have the ability to
8:25:14
understand what happened to take the responsibility in terms of understanding
8:25:21
you've spent a number of years how many years do you say you've been with the agency 29
8:25:27
well I spent 16 years with AT&T moved seven times with them and had a really
8:25:33
good feel about their operations how they worked what was acceptable who was
8:25:38
responsible and I've heard you say today numbers of times well you've got to wait
8:25:44
well you've got to wait wait for the final report when is the final final going to
8:25:52
happen I am how long do we have to wait before you can give us credible answers
8:25:57
you've been there 28 years you've had a few days to be able to draw your own
8:26:03
analysis of this you should understand the entire process you talked about
8:26:08
being on the team perhaps in Georgia you have talked about your uh experience in
8:26:14
this you've talked about the professional nature of the agency that I don't doubt but the director just like
8:26:20
it was when I ran my operations at AT&T was responsible for making sure they
8:26:26
worked and in business either works or it doesn't work there's no in between it
8:26:32
either works or it does not work and your job as the in essence administrator the director is to make sure it looks
8:26:40
right and works and I've not heard you say one thing about my analysis is I
8:26:47
have asked these questions it's always I've got to sit back and wait for someone else to decide that so I'm going
8:26:53
to ask you a question that maybe you can answer have any employees been disciplined for
8:26:59
their role in Butler PA incident no sir not at this time I am
8:27:05
asking those questions so no employee has been disciplined and no employee has
8:27:12
been uh placed in any position that would Place their job in Jeopardy nor
8:27:18
their standing in the agency we are still in the process of intervie that's not what I asked I I you're the person
8:27:25
that runs the place you're the person that knows right from wrong good from bad you've had a number of days and now
8:27:32
you come before this committee knowing you're going to be before forced and you've got to Slough it off to someone
8:27:38
else do you see where there was something that went wrong as a
8:27:44
professional at an agency with 28 years or do you have to count on someone else
8:27:49
to give you the final report I see that something went wrong and I've acknowledged that something went wrong
8:27:56
went wrong was the special agent in charge not doing their job was the
8:28:01
shooter not g was the shooter given extra time was the sniper doing their
8:28:06
job I mean these are things that people who've been around for 28 years can analyze quickly I watched it live on TV
8:28:16
and then within minutes saw a number of facts and factors that would have and
8:28:22
should have been known by people who were there you've got 20 8 years you're showing up here telling us and the
8:28:29
American public well I've got to wait for the final answer what is your evaluation I'm asking those same
8:28:35
questions well no you're you're before the committee tell us what went wrong a
8:28:41
special agent in charge the person who was there tell us and don't try and play
8:28:46
a shell game with us do you have the ability to effectively as the Director
8:28:52
of this agency to understand what went wrong and at least tell us uh I do or
8:28:59
don't know what I'm doing and We Come Away with and I'm not asking for you to
8:29:04
resign I'm asking for you if you've got this experience then you should be able
8:29:09
to say to us we know what we did wrong it was a failure in our system and we're
8:29:15
immediately making these Corrections that's why you're having a difficult time with this group of members of
8:29:22
Congress because we saw it too we we've seen the things but you are the 28-year
8:29:29
expert you are the person that and only you that can make the changes and I hear
8:29:34
you say well I've got to wait for a final report before I at 28 years
8:29:39
experience that is why we think what you're doing the answers you're giving
8:29:45
us are not correct and you are not using your pro professional expertise Mr
8:29:51
chairman I will allow her to respond I am asking those same questions sir and
8:29:58
I assure you when I have a full and complete uh report of exactly what
8:30:04
happened there will be accountability and we will make changes before I recognize the qu just
8:30:12
out of curiosity director it's been Nine Days Every American wants these
8:30:17
questions answered do you have a ballpark estimate of when what Mr sessions asked you would be able to
8:30:24
answer so I can tell I can tell you on our mission Assurance uh internal
8:30:30
investigation we are targeting to have that completed uh within 60 days there's also an external investigation that is
8:30:37
going to be taking place there are a number of office of Inspector General investigations as well and we are
8:30:42
working in concert and then of course there's the Department of Justice FBI criminal investigation chair chair
8:30:48
recognizes Mr CIO Cortez from New York thank you uh Mr chairman um director
8:30:55
cheel respectfully uh what you had just laid out about 60 days uh we are
8:31:01
currently in the midst of a uh of of an
8:31:07
especially concentrated presidential campaign in the moment uh that is also
8:31:13
paired with of course elections happening across the country that are happening in about a 100 days so the
8:31:20
notion of a report coming out in 60 days when the threat environment is so high
8:31:26
in the United States irrespective of party is not acceptable and I think it's
8:31:31
very important to understand that this is not theater this is not about jockeying this is about the safety of
8:31:38
some of the most highly targeted and valued targets
8:31:44
internationally and domestically in the United States of America so the idea
8:31:49
that a report will be finalized in 60 days let alone prior to any actionable uh
8:31:56
decisions that would be made is simply not acceptable it has been 10 days since
8:32:02
an assassination attempt on a former president of the United States regardless of party there need to be answers again
8:32:11
this party this this this committee this is not a moment of theater we have to make policy decisions and we have to
8:32:17
make them now we do and that may be a a and that may require legislation that
8:32:24
may require policy that we must must pass the immediate uh uh term and
8:32:29
without that we are Flying Blind so the lack of answers and the lack of report
8:32:35
is just simply not something that we can accept here um director cheel is there a
8:32:41
standard perimeter that the Secret Service establishes around an event or
8:32:46
are those perimeters independently determined per event and scenario there is no standard uh every event and every
8:32:53
ven venue is different and treated as such so they so each event has a
8:32:59
different uh perimeter that is established depending on on the logistics of that event now you
8:33:05
established earlier that the building upon which the shooter uh operated from
8:33:11
was outside of that established perimeter correct for the Butler Pennsylvania event it was outside of our
8:33:18
secure perimeter yes now that um that building was I believe 500 how far away
8:33:26
was that building from from the president uh it was approximately 200 yards 200 yards
8:33:33
now the individual uh used an
8:33:39
AR-15 in order to uh act out his assassination attempt an AR-15 has a
8:33:46
range of about 4 to 600 yards my question is why does the Secret Service
8:33:54
perimeter um why is the Secret Service protective perimeter shorter than one of
8:34:01
the most popular semi-automatic weapons in the United States there are a number of weapons out
8:34:09
there uh with a number of ranges uh again an advance was completed uh the
8:34:14
determination of the perimeter I'm not going to speak to specifics but there are a number of factors that are taken
8:34:20
into account when we determine our perimeter some of it has to do with terrain some of it has to do with building some of it has to do with
8:34:26
assets and resources uh that are available and so what I'm what I'm
8:34:32
hearing is that a perimeter was not established outdoors in an outdoor venue
8:34:38
that would prevent an AR-15 which is one of the most common weapons used in mass
8:34:44
shootings um from being able to to be within the range of Secret Service
8:34:49
protection a perimeter was established and even though there were buildings that were outside of that perimeter it
8:34:55
wasn't just that building there were a number of buildings in the area uh and there was OverWatch that was created to
8:35:02
help mitigate some of those buildings um respectfully Dr cheel as
8:35:08
well um as a person who has experienced an enormous amount of threat
8:35:14
incidents including incidents that have never been reported publicly
8:35:21
um what there's a there is a common pattern that happens here whether it's
8:35:27
Secret Service FBI Capital police local departments after a critical security
8:35:32
failure we often here there will be an independent investigation that independent investigation gets set up
8:35:38
usually the expectation is between two to three months after the incident and then nothing really occurs from there
8:35:45
the report is usually not satisfactory to the questions that are usually being raised here and uh most importantly
8:35:53
corrective action is rarely taken um my if I were to to state anything
8:36:00
that I think is profoundly important is that we need to have answers to the public ideally I would encourage uh you
8:36:08
and the agency to be more forthright with the members that still have yet uh to have their questioning because the
8:36:15
public deserves to have full confidence and the stakes are too high the violence
8:36:21
that could break out in this political moment regardless of party in the event of someone getting hurt
8:36:29
constitutes a national security threat to the entire country thank you n back could I go back to something you yes
8:36:35
please feel free director ma'am if if I could just speak to something you said at the outset uh when you started your
8:36:41
questioning uh I want to assure you and everyone on this committee that I'm not waiting for a report to take action we
8:36:49
have been conducting analysis all along and we have been uh adding additional
8:36:54
features to to our security details uh since this incident occurred and I I'd hope you can
8:37:02
highlight and illuminate what some of those are uh in the event of of other members questioning as well very good
8:37:08
chair recognizes the uh gentleman from Arizona Mr Bigs thank you Mr chairman I request uh unanimous consent for that
8:37:14
photo to go into the official record without objection to ordered thank you director your agency has a no fail
8:37:20
Mission and on Saturday July 13th your agency spectacularly failed the failure
8:37:25
resulted in the death of Corey comor and serious injury to two other rally attendees David Dutch and James
8:37:32
copenhaver besides the injuries to president trump it is unfathomable that
8:37:37
a 20-year-old on the radar of secret service and local law enforcement before President Trump went on stage was able
8:37:44
to climb onto the roof of a building with a rifle and fire off multiple rounds before he was neutralized was Mr
8:37:49
krooks acting alone again I would have to refer you to the FBI I's investigation was he just a
8:37:58
lone gun man I would have to refer you to the FBI's investigation for
8:38:04
motive what did the technical services division determine was going to be the event
8:38:09
perimeter those are questions that we are asking and we are you I mean you're sitting here today come on director
8:38:17
everybody said this you knew you gonna be asked that question because it's been asked multiple times so so this is an
8:38:24
easy one what did they determine was going to be the event perimeter so you should know that I mean this is not I got to wait
8:38:31
till someone else tells me what was it again I don't want to speak to
8:38:36
specifics of the event place this this is a specific I understand this is a
8:38:42
specific that you ought to know as someone who said the buck stops with me I'm going to stay in my job I'm going to
8:38:48
give the answers to the American people and I know what happened except for you're not going to tell us and you're
8:38:54
not going to tell the American people and you yourself said in an interview that that FS this notion of conspiracy
8:39:01
theories guess what when you sit here and repeatedly tell people hey I have to
8:39:07
wait as have frustrated everybody on this committee guess
8:39:12
what it undermines your credibility and whether you're really going to get to it
8:39:17
so I'm going to ask you again what did the technical service division determine was going to be the event perimeter
8:39:25
we are still Gathering reports we are interviewing individuals you know you know what it is though no you're just not going to tell us right when I have
8:39:31
those details I will most certainly share those was the gun already on the roof or did the shooter carry the gun up
8:39:38
with him I do not have that information at this time well when was the last
8:39:43
sweep of that roof done prior to the rally I do not have that information at
8:39:49
this time so um how many holds I mean so so most of us here have been been in
8:39:56
events and secret service has been there there's been security and I can't tell you how many times um we've we've said
8:40:03
there's going to be a security hold right here so we're going to wait and we wait to one or two or three two or three
8:40:09
minutes uh and and yet we're hearing from you apparently that there were no
8:40:15
holds in place so ever in instituted here with President Trump's uh going on
8:40:21
stage and you said and this is I think connected with this you said uh they hadn't adjudicated the shooter
8:40:27
to be a threat he was adjudicated to be a suspicious person even though we've got some D Dynamic video that Mr Christ
8:40:34
Morton put on the on the video for us so I guess my question for you is and I think you answered this I just
8:40:41
want to see if you're consistent with what you said about an hour and a half ago what do you do if a suspicious person is is uh is identified by the
8:40:50
agency so at a number of our events it is not unusual I know it's not unusual what do
8:40:55
you do those individuals that are identified as suspicious we will send
8:41:01
teams out to was it team s was a team sent out here then there were teams that
8:41:06
were sent to identify and interview that individual they they were sent to
8:41:12
interview the individual who's scampered up in camo on top of a roof within 130
8:41:17
yards of his Target and did they did your team get
8:41:24
there when did your team get there to conduct that interview I don't have the details on the timeline it is my so so
8:41:33
if you did send if their team if they did send a team and they're going to interview him
8:41:39
and you said you described that earlier as an investigation why didn't they put a security hold on President Trump going
8:41:46
on stage at that rally at a number of our protective sites there are
8:41:51
suspicious individuals that are identified all the time it doesn't necessarily mean that they
8:41:58
constitute a threat of course not but here you guy got a guy scampering up the
8:42:03
side of a building on top of a roof it's identified to you and you said you sent a team there and and uh you can't answer
8:42:11
that and this gets to my one of my finer points Mr Mr chairman if I can make it and that is we can have these kind of
8:42:18
interview sessions five minutes you know everybody gets a kiss at the pig five minutes and and she gets ston Wallace
8:42:26
not deliver answers so we say okay we're going to put together a congressional committee a blue ribbon committee same
8:42:33
crap will happen I am calling and and I'll support that but I will tell you
8:42:38
this I am calling on the speaker to give us and and put together a truly
8:42:44
independent Commission of qualified former secret service agencies uh
8:42:49
presidential and VIP protect Protective Services people who can actually conduct this kind kind of of investigation and
8:42:57
give us real answers because I don't think you can you're going to give us those answers you should have come today
8:43:03
ready to give us answers I call upon you to resign today today and I also would
8:43:08
say I've got a bunch of uh UC requests if I can go ahead Mr chairman proceed with the request thank you I I apologize

8:46:54
into the record all of those and we'll take up the others uh after the next speaker chair now recognizes Miss Brown
8:46:59
from Ohio for five minutes thank you Mr chairman I first want to highlight certain comments from ranking member
8:47:04
Rasin my colleagues on both sides of the aisle President Biden and vice president Harris and that is political violence is
8:47:12
completely unacceptable in this country full stop it is an assault on our democracy
8:47:19
itself and I am devastated by this attack on a candidate for the president for the Office of the highest office in
8:47:26
the land and continue to pray for the victims of this shooting and their families as someone who has known gun
8:47:33
violence firsthand no one should have to experience the pain of losing a loved
8:47:38
one to weapons of war it is deeply unfortunate political violence has
8:47:44
become far too common whether it is the deadly attack on the capital on January
8:47:49
6 The Assault on speaker Pelosi's husband or the threats of violent
8:47:55
against election workers we all must work to condemn political violence and
8:48:01
tone down the rhetoric so director Cheeto on behalf of
8:48:06
the hardworking men and women of the Secret Service can you give us some perspective as into what goes into
8:48:12
securing an an event like the rally like how much time do you have to pre
8:48:17
prepare thank you for the question generally when we receive notification uh that there's going to be
8:48:24
an event taking place at a venue uh the advaned team assignments are made and
8:48:29
there is a five-day process to conduct walkthroughs coordinate with staff uh
8:48:35
local staff and uh whether it be campaign staff or the protecte staff and then with local law enforcement on where
8:48:43
the perimeter is going to be the the size and the scope of the event how many attendees they're going to be if it's an
8:48:49
indoor rally outdoor rally uh what sort of assets are available locally what sort of assets the Secret Service can
8:48:55
bring to bear uh and what the scope of the event that the the staff is trying
8:49:01
to accomplish So to that point how many agents were recommended or requested as
8:49:06
opposed to how many were assigned so I'm not going to get into specifics of how many were assigned but
8:49:12
those numbers that were requested were provided and how many local agents were
8:49:20
involved in the uh preparation if you will that you talked about that 5day preparation so there were a number of
8:49:26
local Agents from the local office uh as well as agents from the former Trump
8:49:32
detail that were involved in that advanced process do we have a number I
8:49:37
do have a number I I'm not going to release that number in the set you're not making this easy for us
8:49:45
um this is a shocking incident on the former president's life and an appalling
8:49:51
instance of political violence and the threat to our democratic values I'm thankful that the former president
8:49:57
is on the men and again I'm grieving for the family and friends of Corey compor
8:50:02
who lost a loved one um in this shooting and now know the unbearable pain of gun
8:50:08
violence I really hope this serves as a reminder about our responsibility to attack policies not personalities to be
8:50:16
honest and truthful and to treat one another with dignity respect and thoughtfulness and with that I yield my
8:50:22
ranking I yield my remaining time to rank ranking member Rasin than thank you Miss Brown for those very powerful and
8:50:28
moving remarks um director Cheeto we don't want to lose a
8:50:35
presidential candidate to an AR-15 attack we cannot lose a presidential
8:50:41
candidate to an AR-15 attack and we can't lose any more citizens to
8:50:48
AR-15 Mass violence mass shootings um and we certainly don't want
8:50:54
attempted AR-15 assassination uh or assassination
8:51:00
attempt to set off political violence or riots in America so this is deadly
8:51:07
serious business the vice ranking member
8:51:12
um pointed out that a report in 60 days won't do it for us because we have a
8:51:19
responsibility members of Congress have a responsibility to take action now if there's anything we can do to prevent
8:51:26
this so my question for you is what is informing your operational decisions
8:51:32
right now that you've invoked uh without a report can you tell us what are the preliminary judgments or
8:51:39
if you don't want to force sh out the report fine what are your personal professional judgments informing the
8:51:45
operational decisions you're making right now certainly and I appreciate that
8:51:52
question uh I I don't want to make any preliminary judgments on what happened on this particular day but I can tell
8:51:59
you that we have looked at uh as we did immediately in the aftermath what the
8:52:04
security plan for the Republican National Convention uh was going to be and we made adjustments to the interior
8:52:10
of their perimeter there we looked at the protectees that we have here in the Washington DC area and our protective
8:52:16
sites and we did make some adjustments uh to their security posture uh and as we continue to move through the next
8:52:24
several weeks uh even yesterday uh with the announcement uh of the president no
8:52:29
longer running we have made adjustments uh to vice president's detail we are
8:52:35
already prepared uh for an eventual VP nominee and we continue to make those assessments I think it just shows how
8:52:41
Dynamic the environment is that this agency Works in every day so you've made the same kinds of Common Sense judgments
8:52:50
and intuitive recommendations that members of the and members of Congress
8:52:55
are asking about right now yes okay thank you are you back Mr chairman and before I recognize miss m i I have to
8:53:03
say director we're pretty close to the halfway point during this you answered more questions with an
8:53:11
ABC reporter than you have with members of Congress we have a lot more questions the American people are demanding that
8:53:17
we get answers to those questions and that's what the purpose of this hearing is today so uh I'm sure a lot of the
8:53:23
questions that have already been asked going to be asked again and hopefully we can get some answers to those questions
8:53:30
I strongly implore you to answer those questions you're here with a subpoena
8:53:36
and we expect you to answer the questions chair now recognizes Miss mace from South Carolina thank you Mr
8:53:41

8:54:54

8:54:59

Washington Post several hours before you sent it to this committee as being
8:55:18

8:55:56
with this committee um on July 15th this committee sent you a list of Demands of

8:56:49
here with this committee these are important questions that the American people want answers to and you're just you're just dodging and and talking
8:56:56
around it in generalities and we had to subpoena you to be here and you won't even answer the questions we've asked
8:57:01
you repeatedly to answer our questions this isn't hard these are not hard questions um have you provided us all
8:57:09
Communications from the secret service related to that day and that rally have you provided this commit we've asked for this information on July 15th have you

8:57:35
we haven't gotten a single document or piece of information or data from you or
8:57:40
your agency in related to the rally that we have asked you for so um is this was uh this uh
8:57:50
attempted assassination of Donald Trump a failure of training or execution or both I think that those are answers that
8:57:57
we need to training execution or both which one I think those are answers all right how many uh how many Secret
8:58:03
Service Personnel have lost their jobs due to this colossal failure at this time
8:58:09
none how many Secret Service Personnel have been required to take a refresher course on how not to let people shoot
8:58:17
Donald Trump our Personnel are currently operational we are examining the facts
8:58:23
of this investigation and we will make the changes necessary what time did law enforcement become aware that there was
8:58:29
an individual on the roof with a clear line of sight to president Trump I am still verifying timelines of course uh
8:58:36
nine days in you have no answers how many minutes went by Between the time law enforcement saw on took photos of crooks in the shooting how many
8:58:43
minutes I am still verifying 57 minutes
8:58:48
thank you Mr chairman and I yield back gentle lady yields back before I recognize M stanbury I believe I want to
8:58:54
recognize Mr inum for a unanimous consent yeah thank you Mr chairman I beg your Indulgence I meant to do this
8:58:59
earlier I'd like to have unanimous consent that it be uh submitted for the record the 2023 ranking of best and
8:59:08
worst workplaces in the federal government uh compiled by the office of
8:59:13
personnel management which shows the United States Secret Service coming in
8:59:18
again as I said earlier 413th out of 450 9 sub agencies uh and
8:59:26
this appears in the July 17th edition of government exec without objection to
8:59:31
ordered chair now recognizes Miss stanbury from New Mexico thank you Mr
8:59:36
chairman um you know I I want to start by just saying that part of why you have
8:59:41
bipartisan agreement here on the dis about the severity and importance of
8:59:46
this hearing is because this is not just a single shooting this is about National
8:59:52
Security and the security of our democracy it's not just one operational failure this is about our our public
9:00:00
officials safe and what does that signal to our country and to the world about
9:00:06
American Security and the ability of our officials to do their job safely so I
9:00:11
want to start by saying thank you to all of our brave men and women who are in the uniform whether it's the Secret
9:00:16
Service or local law enforcement who put their lives on the line I think obviously we honor their service but
9:00:23
this is really about operational failures and what it means for our country at large and I also want to
9:00:29
reaffirm that uh we must condemn unequivocally political violence of any
9:00:35
kind violence of any kind not just political violence and that it cannot be tolerated in this democracy and also to
9:00:43
offer my prayers for the slain um fire chief uh Cory comor and also prayers for
9:00:50
those who've been injured now I think you know the the tone of this hearing is
9:00:56
how is it that a 20-year-old young man with a gun that was legally purchased by
9:01:03
his father could on the day of a rally go to a gun shop legally purchase
9:01:09
ammunition show up to a secured site and then not only attempt an assassination
9:01:15
of a political figure but kill and injure to others how could this
9:01:22
happen I'm not asking you I think we've had a lot of testimony here
9:01:27
today I want to talk a little bit about the timeline now here's what we know and
9:01:33
I know director you were also on the call that we had a few days ago with the FBI and other law enforcement so I
9:01:40
respect that uh you are not able to share based on your testimony some of the details that are currently being
9:01:46
investigated but I know you were on the call because I heard you on the call and you heard them too so I'm going to lay
9:01:51
out the timeline a little bit on July 3rd the rally was announced that it was going to be in Butler on July 6th 3 days
9:01:59
later we know that the shooter searched for dates for Trump and DNC events on
9:02:06
July 7th so this is four days after the announcement the shooter went to the
9:02:11
site he actually physically went to the site on July 12th the shooter went to a
9:02:18
gun range where he and his dad regularly go and practiced shooting and the next day on July 13th
9:02:26
he went to the site again before the rally began we know that he then went
9:02:32
and searched online for gun store where he went and he purchased 50 rounds of
9:02:38
ammunition went home got his father's AR which was legally
9:02:44
purchased and returned to the venue at 5:00 p.m. that evening this is more than
9:02:51
an hour before Donald Trump actually took the stage that evening local law
9:02:58
enforcement made aware were made aware that there was a suspicious man in fact
9:03:03
at 520 local law enforcement flagged that he had a rangefinder and they radioed their
9:03:10
concerns and sent around pictures of the individual at 5:40 20 minutes before
9:03:17
local law enforcement uh actually uh identified the shooter and at 551 Secret Service
9:03:24
notifi was notified of the suspicious person by the state police and one
9:03:30
minute later they distributed that information that was before Donald Trump even took the stage that was 11 minutes
9:03:36
before he took the stage so the Secret Service was aware that there was a suspicious person at 603 he took the
9:03:43
stage at 609 rally goers as was shown in the video identified this gentleman
9:03:49
climbing on the roof at 611 three shots were heard three round rounds of shots
9:03:55
and of course the president and uh the other victims were
9:04:01
shot this shooter was a 20-year-old young man no criminal record legally
9:04:07
purchased gun and ammunition who for days in the leadup to this shooting was
9:04:12
searching Mass Shooters he even had a picture of a mass shooter on his cell phone the day of the shooting he
9:04:20
searched for explosives he searched highlevel officials so the American people want to
9:04:28
know how did a 20-year-old young man with access to a military style weapon
9:04:33
actually bring it on to an unsecured perimeter who for days had been planning a mass shooting event and I think that
9:04:42
Madam director with all due respect the answers that we've received here in this
9:04:47
hearing today are completely unsatisfactory
9:04:56
how could this
9:05:02
happen we need answers we need answers not just for the
9:05:07
family members of the gentlemen who was killed and those who were injured but we
9:05:13
need answers for our democracy because as others have stated here today we are in a highly
9:05:20
politically charged environment right now we are only only weeks away from one
9:05:25
of the most significant presidential elections in in American history and it is
9:05:30
clear that our public officials safety is not been secured and it is not just a
9:05:37
matter of one shooting it is a matter of national security so I hope that you will take
9:05:43
our comments to heart I hope that there will be accountability and we need
9:05:50
answers that I chair now recogniz this Mr lerer from Kansas thank you Mr
9:05:55
chairman director cheel I have a question just right off the bat something that you've bragged about repeatedly is that you've increased
9:06:01
protection for the 36 individuals that the Secret Service is also entrusted with is that
9:06:07
correct I think I stated that we currently have 36 protectees and that we
9:06:12
have uh we continue to make evaluations on where those levels of protection are provided you've mentioned specific
9:06:19
increases in protection that you've provided for some of those individuals correct correct based on what well some
9:06:25
of it has been as a result of the tragic incident that occurred on the 13th we went back and reassessed where we were
9:06:32
at in providing protection and wanted to make sure that we were not you know overlooking anything uh considering this
9:06:40
this most recent incident so the Secret Service needed to learn that allowing a rooftop 150 yards away from a protecte
9:06:49
not putting that in a perimeter not having someone guarding that roof that information is new to you and it's
9:06:54
caused you to increase protection to other folks that are under your care I think it is prudent after any incident
9:07:02
that occurs to go back and take a look at your current practices and see if
9:07:07
there is anything that needs to be done differently it's inconsistent because what you said earlier to uh Mr Turner
9:07:13
was that the protection that you were offering to president Trump was in line with the current threats him being a
9:07:19
former president him being a nominee of a major uh political party the threat from Iran the protection that you
9:07:25
providing him was adequate do you stand by that statement yes okay do you think
9:07:31
it's a problem that the Americans trust in the federal government is an all-time low do you think that's a
9:07:38
problem I think that it's unfortunate I I don't know why you're quibbling with my word is it a problem
9:07:44
or is it not I think the American public deserves to have trust in their federal government okay I don't know why you're
9:07:50
being difficult I'm I'm just it's a simple question are you concerned about the increasing prevalence of conspiracy
9:07:57
theories going on out there right now yes I am too you've been incredibly
9:08:02
inconsistent with your answers before this committee today and what you were willing to reveal you've acknowledged
9:08:08
that the shooter was identified with a rangefinder that President Trump's detail was sufficient for the threats he
9:08:13
faced from Iran that certain details were erroneously reported in your words
9:08:19
but you haven't been willing to provide any information about the decision to place the building in question outside
9:08:24
the perimeter the explosives placed in the shooter's vehicle the use of a drone
9:08:30
by the shooter or when exactly the Secret Service identified the shooter as a threat rather than merely suspicious
9:08:36
what is your standard today for what you are willing to answer and what you are not because you've been
9:08:42
inconsistent I'm certain that you can understand that some of the information that's been provided to you thus far has
9:08:47
come from the FBI's investigation and has come from uh information that we
9:08:52
have released I want to make sure that information that is being provided to this committee is consistent and is in
9:08:58
factual but the question about the Drone that the chairman asked at the beginning of the hearing he said do you know this
9:09:04
information and you acknowledge that yes you do know the information you just don't want to tell us I guess my
9:09:09
question is is that if you wanted to wait till the end of the investigation to draw conclusions which you've
9:09:16
acknowledged you're not you're drawing conclusions right now and making changes but if if that was your standard that you want to wait till the end of the
9:09:21
investigation to draw conclusions okay at least you would be uh consistent
9:09:26
in that but what what we're wanting to know today and what would dispel some of
9:09:31
the conspiracy theories out there what would increase trust in the with the American people is for you to let facts
9:09:37
out for you to tell us what you know and I want to understand from you why is that a problem why is it inconsistent
9:09:44
with a quality investigation to release to the American people today at least the information that you know for sure
9:09:50
because you certainly know for sure more information you're willing to give us
9:09:55
today I have released that there was a failure and that there are gaps that we
9:10:01
need to make sure in that they don't happen again that's not acceptable that's not enough that doesn't quell any
9:10:08
conspiracy theories out there in your 27 years of experience would you have been concerned about an
9:10:14
elevated location within 150 yards of a protect that did not have a secret service presence just based on your
9:10:21
experience what I can tell is at every site and every venue I'm asking for your experience
9:10:28
looking at this situation would that have been of concern to you or would you have agreed that it's fine it doesn't
9:10:33
need to be covered what I have explained today is you're not going to answer is it true that at 5:45 p.m. approximately
9:10:39
18 minutes before President Trump took the stage the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit noticed the shooter on the
9:10:45
roof and photographed him is that a fact or not that is the information that I have from the FBI's report yes you
9:10:51
haven't been willing to share whether or when this was communicated to the Secret Service so I'd like to get into the
9:10:57
difference between suspicious activity and threatening activity is it suspicious or threatening if an
9:11:03
individual is seen around the perimeter with a rangefinder is that just suspicious that could be termed as
9:11:09
suspicious if that same individual with the rangefinder is found on a rooftop is
9:11:15
that still just suspicious or is that uh is that considered threatening that
9:11:20
could be termed still as suspicious my time is over Mr chairman I yield back
9:11:26
thank you chair now recognize Mr Frost from Florida thank you so much Mr chair on obviously want to start by stressing
9:11:33
stressing that political violence is always unacceptable um and acknowledging that this is still an ongoing
9:11:38
investigation but oversight hearings like this are essential components of an investigation and I want to thank the
9:11:44
chair for pulling this together um Madame director I appreciate you for being here the events of July 13th raise
9:11:50
serious questions about the efficacy and thoroughness of the security protocols in place the gravity of the fact that an
9:11:57
unsophisticated gunman was able to secure his perch and take a shot at a former president despite multiple layers
9:12:04
of security and intelligent are not loss on me uh before I came to Congress I used to work advance for a major
9:12:10
political candidate and have interacted with many different law enforcement agencies on large political events like
9:12:16
the one that just happened how many times was the Secret Service alerted about a suspicious person at the July
9:12:23
13th campaign event prior to the first shot being shot I don't have an exact number to
9:12:29
share with you today but uh from what I've been able to discern uh somewhere
9:12:35
between two and five times there was some sort of communication about a suspicious individual to to the Secret
9:12:42
Service specifically according to reports the shooter was photographed twice by security officers prior to the shooting
9:12:48
a police officer saw the shooter on the ground and reported him with a photo PHH as a suspicious person multiple local
9:12:56
Law Enforcement Officers identified the shooter radioed that he was acting suspiciously near the events
9:13:03
magnetometers um a local law enforcement Tactical Team saw the shooter on a roof
9:13:08
and notified other Security Services and also photographed him one police officer who was photographed The Who
9:13:14
photographed the shooter saw him scoping out the roof and carrying a rang finder
9:13:19
my question is and you've answered this but why or you haven't answered this why wasn't the event pause right
9:13:27
then again I'm not clear on the timeline of when the Secret Service shift and the
9:13:34
counter sniper were notified but earlier Madam director earlier you said that the Secret Service would have paused the
9:13:40
rally if they identified a threat correct so why wasn't it paused because
9:13:47
I have to assume that they did not know that there was a threat when they brought the president out on the
9:13:54
stage I feel like this is a breakdown in communication between local law
9:14:00
enforcement youall and other actors at the rally and again as someone who's worked on these I understand that
9:14:05
there's multiple people with multiple decision uh with the ability to make different decisions on the ground I've
9:14:12
taken the over the last week I've spoken with a lot of folks in local law enforcement in my district and across
9:14:18
the country that I've worked with before and other people have brought up concerns around um Comm being able to
9:14:25
communicate with law enfor or with Secret Service during these big events and having um their Flags taken
9:14:30
seriously I do believe that if Secret Service believed that there was a legitimate threat that they would have paused the rally my concern is before
9:14:37
that that there something was flagged and it wasn't taken as seriously as it should have been taken um so I think
9:14:45
this shows an issue with communication and I want to know Madam director what you intend to do to fix that not in 60
9:14:51
days but now we in the middle of u a presidential election obviously a former
9:14:56
president who had uh who had an attempt assassination attempt another rally grower who was killed due to this gun
9:15:03
violence we now have a presumptive nominee the Democratic party who's also historic first black woman to be running
9:15:10
for president and so I am worried about everybody's life what do you all intend to do to fix this communication
9:15:16
breakdown and making sure that you you actually take uh what LO local law
9:15:21
enforcement local folks are saying more seriously we take what local law
9:15:27
enforcement relats to us seriously let me just be clear on that uh as far as the communication but not this not this
9:15:34
time we always trust our law enforcement partners and have a great relationship with them uh we are looking at whether
9:15:41
or not there was a communication breakdown uh if that was the case we will take steps to ensure that we
9:15:47
correct that because to your point we cannot have a communication breakdown mad director does the per uh the per you
9:15:55
mentioned that the perimeter of the event did not include the rooftop where the shooter was does your responsibility
9:16:01
and the secret service's responsibility to protect a principal stop at the perimeter of an
9:16:08
event our responsibility is to ensure the safety and security of the event
9:16:13
itself and the protecte who is attending that event and the Personnel who are protecting so you would say the fact
9:16:19
that the rooftop was outside the perimeter is is not an excuse for what happened saying that it was outside the perimeter of the event I am not offering
9:16:26
that as an excuse okay thank you I yield back gentleman yields back chair now recognizes Mr Fallon from Texas how did
9:16:34
a 20-year-old loner with a week's notice pick the absolute best location
9:16:39
to assassinate president Trump when the entire Secret Service missed it director chel in your leadership your agency got
9:16:45
out Smart in andout maneuvered by a 20-year-old how can we have any confidence that you could stop a trained
9:16:51
professionals from a nefarious State those are absolutely questions
9:16:57
that we need to have I know questions but you know the fact of the matter is we can't have that confidence director do you have the ability personally do
9:17:04
you have the authority to beef up security of any of your protectees yes I do okay so were you
9:17:10
also aware there was a credible threat uh president Trump was facing he was facing a heightened security threat to
9:17:15
do to a foreign adversary yes okay so given that there was an increased threat
9:17:21
to president Trump's life was he provided a full security compliment akin to what a sitting US president would
9:17:27
receive he was provided a full complement of Security based on the
9:17:33
threat assessment that we had that's not my question the venue my question is if he'd been the sitting president would he
9:17:38
have had the same security he had on July 13th or would have been beefed up there is a difference between the city
9:17:45
pres so your answer is he didn't and continuity of government and the responsibility he did not okay there
9:17:50
wasn't a cat team full cat team on site there wasn't counter Sur balance teams on site but this is the thing you just
9:17:57
said you had the ability to beef up the security you knew about the threat and you didn't and that's as telling as it
9:18:03
is chilling we have satellite images from the butler Fairgrounds have you visited
9:18:09
the site no I have not nine days and you have not visited the site you should have been there that night did you talk
9:18:15
to that evening did you talk to the team the heroes that surrounded the president did you call them that night they still
9:18:23
operational working so that's the answer is no did you call him the next day president yes I spoke with you call him the very next day not the day of or was
9:18:30
it 72 hours after I don't know the timeline but I spoke with them because you're under Ro immedately I think it
9:18:35
was 72 hours after you waited three days what is immediately clear is that there are a number of structures that need to
9:18:40
be secured of these director other than the first you know immediate four what's the most dangerous site that should have
9:18:47
been secured because you know security 101 you got to mitigate The High Ground yes okay do you know what the
9:18:53
next most dangerous site what was the closest structure to the president other than the four immediate ones that you
9:18:59
had your counter sniper teams on there are a number of structures around that event site you you know who the shooter
9:19:07
knew the shooter has visited the site two more times than you have and he had a drone and he picked the AGR building
9:19:13
so you said do you remember in a ABC interview you did that you didn't have people on the roof of the AGR building
9:19:18
because you were worried about safety because of the slope I recall that statement
9:19:24
okay does the Secret Service have written policy you can share with us about slope
9:19:30
roofs no okay so why' you act like there was one because is it your practice to
9:19:35
comment on enormous uh n events of nor enormous National implications when
9:19:40
you're ignorant of the facts that's rhetorical so here's the thing with the slopes you go all up to like 1812 you
9:19:47
can go to a 112 which is about as flat as you can get without it being completely flat
9:19:53
and you're saying that there was a danger uh safety concern there but the problem is director you put your counter
9:19:59
snipers on a 312 roof which is steeper than the 112 and by the way the 112 is ADA Compliant you can build a a ramp for
9:20:07
a wheelchair on a 112 roof so these are nothing but pathetic excuses and they
9:20:13
make no sense and they're a bunch of cow Dum all the law enforcement I've spoken with over the last n days are amazed
9:20:19
that the AGR rooftop was not secure and you want to know why because it's dangerous I have never had any long gun
9:20:26
training in my life I own an AR-15 and I last time I shot it I shot it one time my whole life it was six years ago that
9:20:33
is until Saturday where we recreated the events in seavoy Texas we recreated what happened to Butler I was lying prone on
9:20:40
a slope roof at 130 yards at 6:30 at night and I knew he had a scope I didn't
9:20:45
know what kind Red Dot or magnified so I shot eight rounds from both you know what the result was 15 out of 16 kill
9:20:52
shots and the one I missed would have hit the president's ear that's a 94%
9:20:57
success rate and that shooter was a better shot than me it is a miracle president Trump
9:21:03
wasn't killed Corey comp comparat tor's life is over because that damn shooter made it
9:21:09
on the roof and it wasn't the roof that was dangerous it was a nut job on top of the roof you know what else is dangerous
9:21:14
I believe your horrifying in aptitude and your lack of skilled leadership is a disgrace your obious skating today is
9:21:20
shameful and you should be fired immediately and go back to Garden Doritos Mr chairman I'll you
9:21:26
back chair recognize Miss Lee from Pennsylvania uh thank you Mr chair um
9:21:31
I'd like to thank uh the chair the ranking member for coming together and holding this hearing but I have to say I
9:21:37
don't think any of our concerns have been addressed today and what little we've learned has not inspired much
9:21:44
confidence I I will just say that we obviously can't allow the violence we're seeing in this country become the norm
9:21:50
or a common place but that seems to be where we're heading on this occasion it was you know very shockingly a former
9:21:56
president and current uh political candidate at a rally that we all assume is one of the most secure places we can
9:22:04
be but the violence we saw last Saturday is the same culture of violence that makes too many of our kids and our
9:22:09
community members feel unsafe to play outside or to go to class or to Simply live their lives each day but again this
9:22:16
was a political rally and it is supposed to be one of the most secure places so we do have very uh specific question
9:22:22
about that director Cheeto I'd like to start by following up on some of the my colleagues questions U my colleagues Mr
9:22:28
chrishna morphy and Mr Frost highlighted a number of points that showed the shooter presenting an active threat so I'd like to ask you director cheeter to
9:22:34
clarify the protocol what the protocol is for postponing or cancelling an event based on a threat and how the events on
9:22:41
July 13th didn't meet those standards so again I think we're talking about the distinction between suspicious
9:22:48
behavior and a threat and at the time that this individ ual was identified
9:22:54
they were displaying suspicious to behavior I'm still waiting for interviews from the FBI to determine
9:23:00
what it was that identified that individual as suspicious and what those behaviors were to to that question is
9:23:07
suspicious Behavior does suspicious Behavior vary between different events for instance if we have an event with a
9:23:13
president would there not be a heightened standard for suspicious Behavior I think that there are a number
9:23:19
of ways that someone could be identified as suspicious uh and it doesn't matter
9:23:25
whether it's at a rally or an indoor event or who the protecte is I think it's up to law enforcement or citizens
9:23:32
to identify someone as suspicious okay uh thank you according to the Associated Press at least six
9:23:38
different agencies including two Sheriff's Office local police State Police as well as fire and emergency
9:23:44
rescue officials were involved in securing the rally and Butler when there are so many teams uh that are collaborating who takes the lead and how
9:23:50
is that determined the Secret Service is responsible for the security of the site and the coordination and that was the
9:23:56
case on July 13th correct okay changing gears in 2024's
9:24:01
Appropriations budget the Secret Service was given a little over three billion which was about 78 million above what
9:24:07
was requested for 202's Budget you've requested yet another increase how much of these funds goes towards training and
9:24:13
improving protection procedures I would have to get back to you on the training aspect of it but
9:24:20
about 30% of our budget is for uh protected protection uh and facilities
9:24:27
and training but clearly the problem can't be a lack of funding so what exactly do you see as the core problem
9:24:34
that led to this fa failure that led to your agency being outgunned by a 20year old using his father's gun and acting on
9:24:41
his own without a particularly sophisticated plan or technology I think that we are waiting
9:24:47
to determine exactly what those failures or failure was uh so that we can make
9:24:52
sure that the Secret Service is stronger after this so we've heard a lot today that you
9:24:58
can't answer because it's an ongoing investigation that you're still figuring out the details and that you won't
9:25:04
answer basic questions you've said 60 days for the investigation but I simply don't think that's acceptable do you
9:25:10
really plan to keep avoiding questions and the American people's questions ours and the American people's questions for
9:25:16
the next 60 days I'm not avoiding questions I want to make sure that I am providing factual
9:25:23
and accurate information certainly but is there no in between right between
9:25:28
what is obviously a fact and what you can surmise from the details that you already
9:25:34
have I assure you when I have a full and complete uh report of what took place on
9:25:40
that day I will certainly come back and make that available certainly studies indicate that the United States has
9:25:46
experiencing increasing levels of political violence and tension does the Secret Service see increasing political violence as a threat to its work and if
9:25:52
so how is the Secret Service adapting its strategies and protocols to account for increasing political uh political
9:25:59
violence we are constantly evaluating the threats that we receive and monitoring that and we make adjustments
9:26:06
on a daily basis uh to our protectees based on what those threats are uh and
9:26:11
and what actions we need to take yes or no do you believe that stricter controls on the availability of assault weapons
9:26:17
would make it easier for the Secret Service to fulfill its missions of protecting public officials I I think
9:26:22
the Secret Service is tasked with providing a safe environment which is why we put into place a number of
9:26:27
mitigation factors certainly but do assault weapons make it easier or harder for you to do your job I think that any weapon makes it
9:26:34
difficult for us to do our job okay uh i y back chair now recognizes Mr Donalds
9:26:41
from Florida uh thank you chairman uh director real quick at what what time
9:26:48
did was Secret Service aware of the active threat against President
9:26:56
Trump director what time so the Secret Service was aware that there was an
9:27:02
individual who had been identified as suspicious uh and that that individual
9:27:08
uh was attempting to be tracked down at what time I don't have a specific
9:27:13
timeline other than to director it's been nine days I understand at what time I I want to make sure that I give you
9:27:19
factual information sir director have you talked to the agents on the ground that day yes I have you've talked
9:27:27
to all of them your senior team has talked to every agent that was on the ground that day yes we have have they
9:27:33
all corroborated the same time they identified the shooter or they were made aware of the shooter either by attendees
9:27:39
in the crowd or local police department there are a number of reports of when
9:27:45
those times were made was it five minutes before the first shot rang out no generally speaking was it 10
9:27:52
minutes before the first shot rang out no it was was it 15 minutes before the first shot rang out it was less than
9:27:58
that time frame when the it was identified as a threat how many days
9:28:03
before the shooting took place did Secret Service actually do their advanced work to secure the facility that the rally was going to be held at
9:28:10
five days in the five days prior when the when the security uh Advance team
9:28:16
did their work did they that did did they identify the rooftop as a Potential Threat again I'm pulling those reports
9:28:23
and that information it's been nine days Madam director did they know that did they notice a rooftop 150 yards away
9:28:29
that was a Potential Threat yes or no I am certain that the rooftop was noticed I am pulling the reports what was the
9:28:36
security par or the security parameters around securing that rooftop there what did they do there was
9:28:43
OverWatch provided for that rooftop did OverWatch fail I am waiting to hear what the
9:28:50
results of the investigation were so that I can identify where the failure
9:28:55
was who did you talk to that was on the ground that day that was responsible for
9:29:02
OverWatch what are their names I'm not going to provide their names in this setting did you talk to the people that
9:29:08
were providing OverWatch that day I've talked to the people that conducted the Advance on that day and that were
9:29:14
working the shift and were the counter snipers on that day so you talk to the counter sniper team you talk to the
9:29:21
people who were providing OverWatch that day and you talked to the advanced team correct yes sir what did they tell
9:29:28
you we are putting together a comprehensive report so that I can identify exactly where the gaps and the
9:29:35
failures when the counter sniper team was on the roof and they identified that there was a there was a susp there was
9:29:42
suspicious activity on the roof in question what was the chain of commands
9:29:47
orders around the person on set roof CU I'm quite sure sure somebody saw
9:29:54
in in under your organization in Secret Service I'm quite sure somebody saw the
9:30:00
shooter on the roof so what was the communication through the chain of command to deal with said person what I
9:30:08
can tell you is that when the individual was identified by the counter sniper they took one shot and
9:30:16
neutralized that individual but that was after the shooter already took a shot is that correct
9:30:22
that is correct so what you're saying now is that the Secret Service did not see the shooter on the roof until after
9:30:30
the shooter took a shot I do not have all of those details at this time if you don't have those details after nine days
9:30:37
director then what you're telling me is that you guys didn't see it is that correct I am telling you I don't have
9:30:43
all the details of the sequence at this time director it's been nine days either you have the information or you do not
9:30:50
is that correct we are still in the process of conducting interviews and an
9:30:56
investigation some of my colleagues have texted me over the last couple days bipartisan about whether you should lose
9:31:02
your job and I've been quiet on that question because I wanted to see where what you were going to do today um in my
9:31:09
opinion you do need to be fired immediately and it is because this is gross
9:31:15
incompetence and the fact that it's been nine days and these are simple questions to to answer I'm quite sure if I asked
9:31:22
any one of my kids if they got in trouble and I told them to give me the details I would get more answers from them than I'm getting from you right now
9:31:29
and that's what's frustrating on a bipartisan basis on a nonpartisan basis this is a joke and director you're in
9:31:36
charge and that's why you need to go Mr chairman i y back chair now recognize Mr
9:31:42
Goldman from New York thank you Mr chairman um director I I want to follow up and
9:31:51
just understand a little bit why um there is so much information
9:31:58
about this out in the public including some from you and your Communications
9:32:04
team uh and yet you're here pursuant to a subpoena um under oath in front of
9:32:11
Congress and you're unable or unwilling to answer some of those same questions
9:32:17
can you just explain why uh you are answering so many fewer questions here
9:32:23
than you have to the media I'm answering the questions that I'm able to answer based on the fact
9:32:30
that there are multiple ongoing investigations but you've you have answered some of these
9:32:35
questions previously correct to the public to the
9:32:41
media which questions well for did you have an interview with ABC News yes I did okay
9:32:48
and did you explain uh the interaction between local law enforcement and the Secret Service and that local law
9:32:55
enforcement was responsible for securing the perimeter of the building where the
9:33:00
shooter was I said that the Secret Service is responsible for Designing and
9:33:05
implementing and executing the security plan and that we rely on the assistance
9:33:10
of our local law enforcement Partners to assist us with that plan let me ask you something uh were
9:33:17
you given any instructions about what you can and cannot answer here today
9:33:23
my uh ability to answer questions is solely reflective of the fact that there
9:33:29
are multiple ongoing investigations and I want to make sure that I provide
9:33:34
accurate information that doesn't conflict with any of those investigations that are going on so is
9:33:40
it your view that you can't talk about anything that happened that day until those investigations are completed my
9:33:45
view is that I want to make sure that this committee uh and the American public gets correct and actual
9:33:52
information and so is it your view that that has to that can only happen after the completion of the investigation it
9:33:59
is my view that uh when the investigations are complete that we will be able to share that information and
9:34:06
how about before that if I have factual information that I can share before that I absolutely
9:34:13
will I'm guessing you have factual information as to when the suspicious uh
9:34:20
photograph the photograph of the suspicious person was relayed to the Secret Service
9:34:26
there's a time stamp on that text message or whatever it was
9:34:31
correct sir I'm sure you can understand that uh when you're dealing with text messages emails uh and other
9:34:39
Communications the timelines don't always match up not not really if they're timestamped
9:34:47
but let me let me move on um because you have acknowledged that this was a major security failure is that right yes do
9:34:54
you acknowledge that it was a major security failure not to secure the
9:34:59
rooftop of the building that the shooter shot from I believe at this time that the
9:35:06
rooftop was provided OverWatch I acknowledge that we are unaware at this time how the individual
9:35:13
was able to access the roof OverWatch meaning from other counter sniper other
9:35:20
uh higher point points correct um and so was it a failure then that when that uh
9:35:27
shooter was on the rooftop that OverWatch did not identify him before he fired his shots I don't have the
9:35:35
timeline of how the individual accessed the roof where they accessed the roof or
9:35:41
how long they were on the roof let me ask a Qui a couple things
9:35:47
quickly um you have testified here about all resources that the Secret Service
9:35:53
needed to deploy to protect uh the NATO Summit and all of the leaders here is that right yes um does did you have to
9:36:02
rely more on local law enforcement because of the NATO Summit for this
9:36:08
event the Secret Service routinely works with uh local law enforcement at every
9:36:14
event uh it doesn't matter whether it is a NATO Summit nsse the DN I'm sorry the
9:36:19
RNC in no but that's not my question obviously there's a natural give and take as to I'm sure how many agents you
9:36:27
deploy and how much you rely on local law enforcement did you have to rely
9:36:33
more on local law enforcement because there were fewer Secret Service assets
9:36:38
available because of the NATO Summit no um I hope we get answers before the
9:36:46
completion uh I don't like the fact that the media has received far more answers
9:36:52
than Congress has um if this is a function of getting your ducks in a row
9:36:59
I I assume you have access to a lot of these reports and a lot of this information and you should have come prepared here today um and I would just
9:37:06
want to flag Mr chairman before you before um I yield back that I I want to
9:37:13
just point out one thing that that my colleague from Texas uh was talking about uh when he said he recreated the
9:37:20
shooting twice with an AR-15 and he had a 94% success rate 15 out of 16
9:37:29
shots I don't know why that doesn't convince him that we should get rid of AR-15s but clearly we need to do
9:37:36
something about the prevalence of AR-15s and weapons of war on our streets and I yield back chair now recognize Mr Perry
9:37:43
from Pennsylvania thank you chairman director I guess 60 days is the time of
9:37:48
the investigation is that is that the information that you've put out or where did that come from 60 days or is that
9:37:54
just information that the committee members are talking about I stated that earlier today I've
9:38:00
asked okay 60 days so are so are you receiving regular updates you're in charge of the Secret Service this is
9:38:06
about your organization what happened nine days ago are you receiving regular updates from the FBI on their
9:38:13
investigation yes I am so you know some things are true some things are probably not true we want to talk to you about
9:38:19
the things that we're hearing about and find out if they're true have you you've been in contact with the FBI then you're
9:38:25
getting updates on a daily basis right yes Bas based on what you said okay so and are you confident that the person in
9:38:33
question Mr Crooks was the only person firing that day against the president or
9:38:38
the crowd he is he the only one I'm not asking you yet if he acted alone but is he the only one or can you say that with
9:38:45
certainty to the American people that is the information I have at this time yes okay did he does it here he acted
9:38:52
alone that's the information we have at this time okay now let's talk about the
9:38:57
fact that he was noticed as a person of interest of concern suspicion as you say
9:39:03
your Pi team um H how do they stay in there's a sea of people how does the pi
9:39:11
team get to that individual that's in question in the sea of people how are
9:39:16
they how's that individual tracked our protective intelligence teams that work at our sites are paired
9:39:23
up with a local police counterpart uh and so they work in conjunction together
9:39:28
so just follow around or let let me ask you this looking at the site you have multiple perimeters right you have the
9:39:34
secure perim the inside Perimeter you have multiple secure or multiple perimeters was the AGR so-called
9:39:41
building the highest location affecting the site of the rally was it the highest
9:39:48
location I believe the highest location at the site was where our counter snipers were what about the water tower
9:39:54
adjacent what about the how high is the water tower I don't have the uh height on the
9:40:00
water tower okay um seems like water towers are pretty high at least in the photo it looks like it might be there might be actually be a building right
9:40:06
behind the AG are building that is even higher than the building that Crooks fired from you're familiar with cover
9:40:14
concealment and defilade right you're familiar with those terms yes so how would your sniper team or your pi team
9:40:22
track the individual and give vectors to Secret Service on the pi team to get to
9:40:28
that individual to question him and how would you cover the defilade the cover and concealment of low areas that you
9:40:35
can't see from where your sniper team immediately adjacent to the president were was were cited H how would you do
9:40:42
that if you're not up on The High Ground so when our counter sniper teams go out and conduct in advance they have a
9:40:48
methodology and provide a grid system uh that our response teams are able to
9:40:55
uh Vector in if they see something that is troubling so when Mr Jordan asked
9:41:01
about the the assets that were requested let me just ask you about assets
9:41:07
requested were were aerial assets requested for this event from either the
9:41:13
Secret Service or State Police or anybody else drone manned otherwise aerial assets were they requested I
9:41:19
can't speak to what the local they were requested have conversations with the local police but I can tell you that the
9:41:25
assets that were requested from the Secret Service for the site that day were all granted but were aerial assets
9:41:33
re I'm just I didn't ask if you used them or what you used were they requested OverWatch was requested and is
9:41:42
that aerial because OverWatch could mean on the Water Tower or not on the water tower can you be specific ma'am I'm
9:41:47
running out of daylight here I understand if you're asking me uh about specifics whether or not there
9:41:53
was is it not clear what I'm asking you were aerial assets requested by by the
9:41:58
president by secret service by anybody were they requested the Secret Service we felt that we had a a good plan in
9:42:05
place okay okay fair enough how about K9 assets with bomb sniffing or explosive
9:42:11
sniffing capabilities requested didn't say they were present were they requested those requests were fulfilled
9:42:19
they were requested and fulfilled MH so was the crooks vehicle inside any of your
9:42:25
perimeters no it was not it was not how did you so okay so it was not within the
9:42:31
it was not so what was there a device located on Mr Crook's body to detonate
9:42:36
the vehicle that is the information that I have so what would be the point of detonating the vehicle if it was not
9:42:42
inside the perimeter I have no idea what Mr Crook's motivation was ma'am the fact that you
9:42:50
have't closed with this Mr chairman haven't even visited the site I understand there are other things going on but the culture of your organization
9:42:57
the culture that doesn't do you know how tall the president is how tall is the
9:43:02
president president Trump how tall is he I don't he's over six feet tall I don't have okay so do you assign agents based
9:43:08
on their ability to cover physically and carry and carry if necessary the
9:43:15
president of the United States when you assign them to this mission is that a parameter that is considered
9:43:21
I assign agents to work our protectees that are capable and have been trained
9:43:27
by Secret Service I understand they're trained but if you're not tall enough it has nothing to do with we're not mad at
9:43:33
you but if somebody's s feet tall and you're five feet tall there's going to be a Delta there that is problematic in
9:43:40
protecting the protect and I'm asking is that a consideration when you when these agents not saying you but when they're
9:43:47
assigned to the protecte the agents that are assigned to our protectees are perfectly capable so
9:43:54
the culture is what I'm concerned about because the primary objective here seems to be something other than securing the
9:44:00
site securing the the principle and securing the people at the site and that's the concern based on the answers
9:44:06
that you given today so far without a yield Mr chairman chair now recogniz to our protectees are perfectly capable so
9:44:13
the culture is what I'm concerned about because the primary objective here seems to be something other than securing the
9:44:19
site securing the the principle and securing the people at the site and that's the concern based on the answers
9:44:25
that you've given today so far without a yield Mr chairman chair now recognizes Mr moscowitz from Florida uh thank you
9:44:32
Mr chairman thank you for the this hearing uh I want to thank uh your The
9:44:38
subpoena that you sent I want to thank uh ranking member Rasin and your work the letter you sent to the committee and
9:44:44
I also support the creation of a commission to get to the bottom of what
9:44:49
happened director I I I just want to give you an honest assessment of how
9:44:54
this is going for you today did you happen to catch the hearing many months ago in education where there were a
9:45:02
bunch of University professor of University presidents and Alise stonic asked a very easy question and couldn't
9:45:08
get an answer did you see that hearing no I don't think I did okay well
9:45:13
let me tell you it didn't go well and the short end of that story was those
9:45:19
University professors all resigned they're gone that's how this is going for you th this is where this is headed
9:45:26
okay this is I I don't know who prepared you for this I don't know how many times you've
9:45:33
testified in front of Congress but a president was almost assassinated live
9:45:39
on television not just for Americans but for the world to see and this being your
9:45:45
first opportunity I understand there's an ongoing investigation I understand there's things that you can not talk
9:45:52
about but the the idea that we're getting less than you did on television
9:45:57
is something that Democrats Independents or Republicans are going to find unacceptable my high school margorie
9:46:04
stowman Douglas was on the list of mass shootings that representative rank Rasin held up that very day the school
9:46:11
resource officer a police officer did not run into the building he hid in the stairwell while the shooter was in the
9:46:17
building he stayed outside never helped okay he also directed other officers who showed up on the scene not to go into
9:46:24
the building when it was determined that the failures in response and training
9:46:31
and that the sheriff fired nobody in his agency Governor DeSantis then remove
9:46:37
that sheriff I supported the removal so here's my question you said there's going to be accountability I understand you don't want to give us names when you
9:46:43
say that are you telling the committee that once it's concluded you're prepared to fire the people on the ground who
9:46:50
made decisions that day I'm prepared to take the actions necessary no no that's
9:46:55
that that's nonsense okay accountability the failure was human that doesn't mean
9:47:01
they're bad people it means they failed that day and a president was almost a
9:47:06
former president was almost assassinated okay are you prepared to fire the human
9:47:12
failure on the ground yes or no when you have the names of where those failures were their people it's not like a piece
9:47:19
of technology failed it was people who failed that day are you prepared to fire them I don't have an answer as to
9:47:26
whether well then how can there be accountability if you're not prepared to fire someone and the reason why your
9:47:34
name is going to be the person who's held accountable the reason why members in this committee are calling for
9:47:39
resignation and I join in that or for the president to fire you is because you're saying there's going to be
9:47:44
accountability but you can't commit that people are going to get fired let me ask
9:47:50
this question different way if Trump had been assassinated that day if the gunmen had succeeded okay would you have come
9:47:57
and tendered your resignation I would still be sitting here because I would want to ensure the
9:48:04
Integrity of the investigation totally understand that's a fair answer that you would have set up that process but would
9:48:09
you have had the honor to come in front of the committee and say a president was assass former president was assassinated
9:48:14
on my watch there should be new leadership I think that I have admitted that there was no no that's what I'm
9:48:21
asking would you have tendered your resignation if he had been killed that occurred on my watch and I am accountable for that okay but would you
9:48:27
have tendered your resignation if he had been killed I think that I've admitted that
9:48:33
I've taken accountability and will take responsibility okay well let me ask a I
9:48:40
want to follow up on representative Connelly's question in which he asked about guns and and you were not willing
9:48:46
to commit that that makes your job harder this is not about the Second Amendment if there were over 400 million
9:48:51
guns on the streets if all of those guns were machine guns would that make your job harder to protect
9:48:58
people again I think weapons that are out there if all of those guns were rocket propelled grenades would that
9:49:04
make your job harder yes sir yes okay thank you perfect this is not a trick question
9:49:11
thank you okay I I won't ask the other 15 things I was going to do I was going to do drone strikes but it's okay so
9:49:18
that's all we were asking it it creates a challenging environment it has nothing to do with the Second Amendment of people's rights but it does make your
9:49:24
job harder so credit to representative Connelly for asking that question one last thing Mr chairman I'll
9:49:31
conclude you know there was a question asked is an Iranian assassin more capable than a 20-year-old and I have
9:49:37
been tough on Iran I probably have more resolutions on Iran than almost anyone in Congress but I can tell you it isn't
9:49:42
Iranians walking into schools and grocery stores and movie theaters and churches it is 20-year olds right and
9:49:49
some of them are mentally unstable and they have access to guns and they're domestic terrorists someone talked about
9:49:55
Christopher Ray Christopher Ray has talked about domestic terrorism and so yes we collectively come together on
9:50:02
foreign threats and I am not at all debasing the fact that there are foreign
9:50:08
threats here and abroad but there are domestic threats and we have to get to the bottom of how we sto domestic
9:50:16
terrorism because it was a 20-year-old who walked into my high school and killed 177 people he was plenty capable
9:50:22
and he was an Iranian thank you chair now recognize Mr Timmons from South Carolina thank Mr chairman Dro we've
9:50:30
asked you a lot of questions and haven't really got a lot of straight answers I have um intentionally created a line of
9:50:36
questioning that I think that you can answer so the first question is do you agree that the allocation of secret service resources should correspond with
9:50:43
the risk profile of Any Given event a higher degree of risk at one
9:50:49
event should get more resour ources is that fair that is fair okay and when two events occur at the same time in the
9:50:55
same Geographic vicinity that the risk profile of each event should be taken into account and whichever event is
9:51:02
greater risk should receive greater resources that is correct okay so I'm
9:51:08
going to go over the Trump event so this was publicly announced July 3D Butler Pennsylvania the venue is an outdoor
9:51:15
Fairground open air no existing security um the crowd size is was expected to be
9:51:21
tens of thousands it end up being over 20,000 um there were General and specific threats from foreign
9:51:27
adversaries as the chairman of intelligence uh remarked Iran has said they want revenge as well as um when
9:51:33
President Trump was in office he um made a lot of people mad tffs to be included
9:51:39
all over the world and you know president Trump is the former president and the future president so I would say
9:51:44
that that is a fairly highrisk event would you agree yes okay let's
9:51:51
conversely um the first lady had an event at a casino in Pittsburgh just doz
9:51:59
few dozen miles away it was a dinner for the Italian Sons and Daughters of America it was publicly announced on
9:52:04
July 10th what's interesting is that the casino is actually extremely secure they already have magnetometers uh existing
9:52:11
prior to this event even being announced it was in a ballroom and the size of the crowd a mere
9:52:17
400 there were no specific threats there may have been General General threats uh and the um asset is the first lady
9:52:26
um those seem like uh there's a huge disparity uh relative to risk would you
9:52:33
agree yes okay thank you um multiple whistleblowers and various media Outlets
9:52:40
have reported that the Pittsburgh field office of the Secret Service allocated 12 additional post standers to the first
9:52:46
ladies event and three additional post standers to the Trump rally is that correct there were no assets that were
9:52:54
diverted from the first no no no this is a very simple question I'm not asking anyone was diverted did the first ladies
9:53:01
event that was relatively secure especially compared to Trump's rally get 12 assets and the first did the first
9:53:10
ladies event get 12 assets and Trump's get three from the Pittsburgh field
9:53:16
office it's that's a yes or no if you don't know don't answer it I mean if you don't know Personnel that were allocated
9:53:22
to both of those events were comparable to the risk at both of those events wow
9:53:28
really so you think that the Pittsburgh Casino 400 person in a ballroom with
9:53:34
Ingress egress through probably a very well-guarded parking garage was four times more dangerous than a 20,000
9:53:41
person rally in an open field with uh the former president and future president you think that that's four
9:53:47
times more dangerous the casino event I didn't say that at all well they got four times of resources from the Pittsburgh field office who was likely
9:53:53
in charge of the final walkthrough for both for both events I mean we've continually highlighted the failures uh
9:53:58
of the secret service at the Trump rally and you know you have the the former and future president getting shot you have
9:54:04
uh multiple uh injuries one fatality and I would have to think that if we had
9:54:11
nine more post standards nine more individuals that have the training and
9:54:17
the integration into the Secret Service uh defense of of trump at that rally that I have a feeling that Crooks would
9:54:24
have had somebody come say hello to him before he fired a bunch of shots what do you think that's possibly true there
9:54:29
were significantly more assets and resources available at the former president's event than there were at the
9:54:36
first who made the decision to deploy 12 uh post standers to the casino uh where
9:54:43
the first lady was having a 400 person dinner and only three people from the Pittsburgh field office to the 20 ,000
9:54:50
plus person plus Trump rally who made that decision there were additional secret service resources available at
9:54:57
the former president Trump's event who made the decision to deploy 12 to the
9:55:03
first ladyes event and three to the Trump event the allocation of resources
9:55:08
is decided based on the availability of personnel and their location and where they are but there were sufficient
9:55:14
resources what did you just say were given to did you just say there were sufficient resources president Trump
9:55:20
shot someone got killed there were not sufficient resources clearly it it doesn't take 27 years of experience to
9:55:27
know that and whoever made that decision it probably wasn't you needs to be fired and then you need to resign because this
9:55:32
is absolutely unacceptable and you've lost the trust of the American people with that Mr chairman I yield back
9:55:38
gentleman yields back chair i recogniz m TB from Michigan thank you so much Mr chair thank you director for being here
9:55:45
you know when we hear the the headline a 20 year year old young man with access
9:55:50
to an assault weapon commits an Mass you know Act of mass violence I mean we've
9:55:56
heard this before over and over again but the unfortunate thing is that my
9:56:01
residents don't get a Committee hearing we have not had one Committee hearing about the over 260 mass shootings that
9:56:08
we've had killing hundreds of people injuring hundreds changing their lives
9:56:15
forever and don't get me wrong to many of my colleagues I mean I watched and even even the pool of blood the screams
9:56:23
it was horrific but it made me think about the images I saw after mass
9:56:29
shootings at schools grocery stores I mean I think of Buffalo New York at a supermarket where a racist gunmen killed
9:56:36
10 Shoppers with an AR an El Paso AK-47 style assault rifle killed
9:56:46
22 in Florida and Parkland Florida 17 students and teachers murdered again
9:56:52
with an AR in Pittsburgh at a place of Faith
9:56:57
Tree of Life synagogue 11 murdered and don't get me about Newton
9:57:02
Connecticut which still breaks my heart 26 murdered including 20 elementary school children this year in Michigan
9:57:09
we've had Mr chair two mass shootings 21 shot in Detroit bigest large one of the
9:57:17
most horrific shootings we've seen two killed at a splash pad in Rochester
9:57:24
Hills Michigan eight shot there again an assault weapon used but the difference
9:57:31
here is the former president gets a hearing in his attempt to say but my our
9:57:39
residents don't get a hearing about mass shootings about gun violence in our
9:57:48
country you know Mr chair I I ask this wholeheartedly you know they don't have
9:57:54
Secret Service to protect them they don't I don't have these Mass agencies
9:58:00
protecting our kids in the schools or the supermarket movie theaters or going to a black party in Detroit I don't have
9:58:06
that we don't have that but I can't believe we're just going to focus on that and not the fact
9:58:12
that we're hearing yet again in the headlines a 20-year-old young man having access to an assault weapon a weapon of
9:58:18
War many of my veterans say they have to be trained to use but he can get it wasn't safely
9:58:25
stored by the parent grabbing that gun and innocent lives were lost
9:58:34
director I know you got asked about this and and I think it's important though you you know for us to hear
9:58:41
this but how how difficult is your job when there's such easy access to assault
9:58:47
weapons in the streets
9:58:52
I think the job of a secret service agent and officer is incredibly difficult I think the environment we
9:58:57
deal with every day and the Dynamics of the threat environment is uh incredibly
9:59:03
difficult these are brave men and women who put their lives on the line and a day like we had on July 13th is a day
9:59:10
that no one in my agency ever wants to have as their responsibility it is it is
9:59:16
an incredibly difficult job yeah I immediately thought of the children in the audience I mean when you think about
9:59:21
going to Rally with your family um again their lives are forever
9:59:26
changed the incident wasn't are never isolated I really believe these incidents are never isolated and I know
9:59:33
Detroit Free Press had reported that the 20-year-old uh Pennsylvania shooter looked up the 2021 Oxford High School
9:59:40
shooting in in Michigan can you comment on what information this shooter was looking up in regarding the tragedy of
9:59:47
Oxford High School where it took four of our high school youth there I'm sorry I'm not able to uh the FBI has
9:59:53
those details so you can't even tell us I mean was he looking at the type of weapon how many yeah unfortunately I
10:00:00
don't have those details do you have I mean did they share that with you though I don't have the full content of what
10:00:05
his searches were I think that they are still in the process of uh examining all of his
10:00:11
devices okay um again you know again the impact I I I want to be really serious
10:00:18
about this the impact on our families is more than just this political rally Mr chair we have to talk about this even if
10:00:24
we're in disagreement let's talk about it because I've seen statistics that show that we could be saving lives now
10:00:30
if we ban these weapons of war from our uh from being able to buy it at the local store down the street I mean we
10:00:35
just can't continue to allow this to happen and unfortunately my colleague my my residents are not former presidents
10:00:41
of the United States they don't get a hearing they don't get secret service any of that and even among those that
10:00:46
are expressing the failed in the system they just deserve better they truly do thank you and I yield chair now
10:00:53
recognize Mr burett from Tennessee thank you Mr chairman uh miss cheel the shooter was set up on the roof of the
10:00:58
AGR International building as we know was the roof identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally to
10:01:05
my knowledge yes it was were agents or officers inside the building if so what floor were they
10:01:12
on we had local police officers inside the building the roof looks like it's a 10
10:01:18
roof how did no one inside that building here someone moving on top of a metal roof I don't have the details of all of
10:01:25
the interviews that have been conducted yet when will you have those I have been asking and I want to have that
10:01:31
information uh as soon as as you do as okay why did Secret Service fail to block the line of sight from that
10:01:37
roof I think that the Secret Service put together a plan where they were counting that roof in as part of their
10:01:44
OverWatch and that was the plan that they had put in place that day if you weren't going to put a security
10:01:49
Personnel on the roof why not at least use drone technology or aerial surveillance to monitor the rally there
10:01:56
are a number of times that we do use uh drone technology I'm not speaking specifically to this event and what was
10:02:01
utilized or not uh there are times when drone technology is available and helpful at events and there are times
10:02:08
when it is not appropriate do y'all use signal do you use personally use signal to communicate with any official from
10:02:14
the White House signal on your phone oh uh on
10:02:20
occasion uh I'm sure that there are people that use signal yes okay do you
10:02:25
person do you use it to speak with the White House you signal no I do not okay
10:02:31
when was Thomas krooks first identified as a person of interest let me help you at 510 he was
10:02:39
uh spotted with a rangefinder at 551 secret and and when did you when did
10:02:46
Secret Service notice him again I don't have those specific timelines but it was a relatively short period of time let me
10:02:53
help you 552 Miss cheel why was President Trump allowed on stage 10 minutes after the Secret Service spotted
10:02:59
a suspicious individual that seems to me to be the worst thing of all all the
10:03:04
breakdown and all this communication all the BS you've been feeding us here today are not feeding us that seems to be the
10:03:11
the the question so I as I've stated before there are a number of events where
10:03:16
suspicious people may be uh identified that doesn't necessarily ma'am I submit
10:03:22
to you you got a guy who's going to be the next president of the United States he's on stage I've been to these events we've all been to these events a car
10:03:28
backfires and there's a 15minute dad gum wait that's that's not acceptable did
10:03:34
the Secret Service tell president Trump they' they'd spotted a suspicious individual before he was
10:03:40
shot I am uh unclear as to what the communication was with the former president okay at that time I'll take
10:03:47
that as a no um did y'all deny president Trump's request for more security yes or
10:03:54
no and when was the when was the most recent request for additional
10:03:59
security the rally request uh for security uh all of those requests were
10:04:05
fulfilled and were there any Personnel redirected to Jill Biden's rally no who
10:04:11
made the decision on the direction of of of agents at either one of those
10:04:17
rallies I'm unclear as to your question on the direction of the agents I said who directed those agents to be it Miss
10:04:24
Biden's Rally or president Trump's rally the specific agents so there is a uh a methodology in
10:04:32
which agents are available for assignments uh and they are assigned based on either geographic location or
10:04:39
Logistics uh or flight I appreciate all that but that methodology about got president Trump killed was the security
10:04:46
detail guarding president Trump a temporary detail the Personnel who are assigned to the pr former president's
10:04:52
detail are uh assigned to him why why was there a different detail on the opening night of the convention than the
10:04:59
the detail that was guarding him in Pennsylvania the president has a very
10:05:04
large uh permanent protective detail assigned to him uh they work shift work and so it could be that people you saw
10:05:12
at the rally uh were not working the same shift the day that he was I could assure you ma'am somebody that's a lot
10:05:17
shorter than the president was not at the convention and the people that were cing down behind the the mass of of of
10:05:24
agents that were on top of the president were not in the convention hall at least I didn't see
10:05:30
them you can't answer it seem to answer a single question about an ongoing investigation ma'am and you don't know
10:05:36
when the information will be released publicly are you waiting for the administration to sign
10:05:41
off no I am waiting for the results of the investigation at which time let me ask you one more question you found
10:05:47
explosives in the shooter's possession is that correct the FBI found explosives
10:05:53
do we know how who directed this young man how to make those explosives I believe that the FBI is still looking
10:06:00
into that on their investigation miss cheel you said that the buck stops with me and I agree I don't think you should
10:06:07
resign I think you should have been fired ma'am you are a Dei Horror Story I've told my daughter multiple
10:06:14
times my wife and my daughter we talk to her all the time about how she's going to succeed in life she'll succeed in
10:06:20
life by achieving ma'am you have not achieved today you let the American public down if it was up to me you'd be
10:06:26
gone thank you Mr speak Mr chair chair now recognize M Crockett from Texas thank you so much Mr chair and let me
10:06:33
just pick up where um my colleague from Tennessee left off uh director Cheeto
10:06:39
was the incident on July 13th due to Dei or rather systemic failures in
10:06:45
communication and potentially safety protocols the incident on the 13th has nothing to
10:06:52
do with Dei the incident on the 13th has to do with a failure or a gap uh either
10:06:58
in planning or communication thank you so much in fact um I have a few articles
10:07:05
that I will enter into the record uh once I wrap up that actually uh acknowledge a number of
10:07:12
women specifically um for their Valor in their service whether it's been in
10:07:18
various levels of law enforcement but you know I I want to stick here for for just a second because earlier you had a
10:07:24
conversation in which there was a discussion about training and I I want
10:07:29
to talk about training and I want to talk about the fact that there's been a
10:07:34
little bit of dancing around as it relates to this being a suspicious person and this being a situation that
10:07:41
was perceived to be a threat and it seems as if there's a different analysis that takes place one of my questions has
10:07:48
to do with if you have any bias training that your officers undergo and the
10:07:54
reason that I asked that because as a civil rights lawyer I have learned so many times in having to deal with law
10:07:59
enforcement that there usually is not a perception of a threat when it is a young white male even if they are
10:08:08
carrying a long gun yet a lot of times at least in this country when it comes to law enforcement there is a perceived
10:08:15
threat just by somebody having a little bit more melanin In Their Skin So I'm curious to know because a lot of times
10:08:21
one of the things that we have consistently pushed for on my side of things and when I say my side is once we
10:08:27
are looking at a tragedy in which law enforcement made an error um is the bias
10:08:32
training and whether or not our officers are getting it so I'm curious to know in some of the training that you talk about that is part of your budget has bias
10:08:39
training been part of that yes it is okay thank you um I I know that today is
10:08:44
a rough day it and and on that day in Pennsylvania it was rough day and the
10:08:50
reality is that I understand it and you may or may not know the answer to this question um in the space in which this
10:08:57
event took place it was an open carry space is that correct that is correct okay
10:09:03
so I held from the state of Texas and interestingly enough I was serving in
10:09:08
the state house right after there was a mass shooting in El Paso we had an
10:09:14
opportunity to do right by our citizens in Texas but we did not instead they
10:09:20
passed permitless carry and what my colleagues kept trying to get you to answer because we want to come up with
10:09:26
Solutions we don't want to keep pointing the finger and right now you've got a bunch of fingers that are pointed at you
10:09:31
but our job is to solve problems for the American people and to be perfectly honest the numbers are clear I had I
10:09:39
think almost every Major law enforcement agency come forward and say that they were against permitless carry because
10:09:46
they said that their jobs would be made more difficult unfortunately my colleagues on the other side of the
10:09:51
aisle in the state of Texas decided that they would ignore those warnings and they passed the law instead and right
10:09:57
after they passed that law we ended up with Uvalde and we heard the stories of those officers that were scared to go in
10:10:03
and save those babies because of the firearm in which that in that case
10:10:10
18-year-old had in his hands they also were given an opportunity to say hey raise the age and make it to where at
10:10:16
least you have to be 21 before you possess this type of weapon and they chose not to and we have the facts it
10:10:23
shows and I'll enter this into the record as well if there is no objection deaths from Firearms keep climbing in
10:10:30
Texas decades after lawmakers began weakening gun regulations that is from the Texas Tribune without objection to
10:10:36
order thank you so much the last thing that I'm just going to make a point of saying is that we all care about this
10:10:43
issue because we know that there has been a spike in violence political
10:10:48
violence in this country are you aware of the fact that the numbers are higher right now okay in addition to that and
10:10:56
and I'm going to point a little blame at ourselves because right now you got all the fingers pointed at you but the
10:11:02
reality is that we have a number of congressional members that are consistently engaging in violent
10:11:07
rhetoric and it needs to be toned down the reality is that people are listening and they're paying attention but
10:11:12
unfortunately another thing that is happening because we're not getting answers from you today is the conspiracy theories they have already began have
10:11:19
you heard of any of the conspiracies yes okay the problem with these conspiracies is that when people
10:11:25
believe that say the president of the United States ordered a hit or they believe it was an inside job or whatever
10:11:31
conspiracies they believe because they don't have any facts in front of them that potentially incites the next level
10:11:36
of violence at the next event in retaliation for this so we are only begging for your job as as it relates to
10:11:44
being the director as well as the men and women that you are protecting as their director director that you keep
10:11:50
them safe by making sure that the American people have the information that they need so that they can feel as
10:11:56
if Secret Service is on the side of the American people and ma'am I don't doubt the Secret Service is on the side of the
10:12:02
American people but right now so long as these conspiracy theories continue to Fester it is going to make your job that
10:12:08
much harder thank you so much and I yield chair now recognizes Miss Marjorie Taylor Green from Georgia Thank you Mr
10:12:14
chairman um Miss Cheeto I'd like to remind you that you're under oath
10:12:20

10:13:08
based on the facts that I have at this time you're not answering our questions the advance element coordinates with
10:13:14
other Intel or law enforcement Partners identifies threats and weaknesses at the s and movements we'd like a copy of the
10:13:21
advanced report have you brought it here with you today we will comply with the request for the documentation that has

10:13:38
you're not doing well as Mr Mo moscowitz informed you you have been sitting here
10:13:44
for over 3 hours and I have you know the entire country is demanding you resign
10:13:50
and demanding that you be fired if you do not resign things are not going well for you you need to answer the questions
10:13:57
was there a protective intelligence team and what Technical Resources were utilized for that event specifically
10:14:04
drone or helicop or assets there were a number of technical assets that were deployed for that event
10:14:11
and there was a protective intelligence team that was assigned to that event why was Crooks able to fly a drone over the
10:14:19
entire area the day of the rally and the day of his assassination attempt to my
10:14:25
knowledge he did not fly the drone over the entire area how did he fly a drone over the area period any part of the
10:14:32
area again I would have to go back and check the timeline of when that took place and when the event why didn't you
10:14:37
bring the timeline with you today to answer our questions I don't have all of the answers on the timelines based on
10:14:44
the criminal investigation were you not prepared today to answer our question
10:14:49
I am prepared to answer the questions based on the information uh and wanted to be able to provide do you have a
10:14:55
timeline that you do you have a timeline at all from from any of the
10:15:00
day I have a uh timeline that does not have
10:15:05
specifics that's shocking I that is absolutely
10:15:11
unacceptable that means you are a failure at your job let's talk about
10:15:16
things that are prohibited in Trump rallies and I've been to a lot of trump rallies backpacks and
10:15:22
bags bicycles Firearms uh any type of weapon or any
10:15:31
other item determined to be a potential safety hazard like a range a rangefinder
10:15:36
would be one uh at 510 Crooks is first observed by one of the snipers AGR sniper 1 at the building 510 510
10:15:45
president shot President Trump was shot in the face at 6 11:00
10:15:50
p.m. 528 AGR sniper 1 takes a picture of a bicycle in two bags those belong to
10:15:58
Crooks 532 a sniper 1 spots krooks looking at his phone and using a
10:16:07
rangefinder 555 Butler ESU command confirms receipt of photos and States
10:16:12
they have been relayed on 6:05 p.m. AGR sniper 1 later communicates that Crooks
10:16:19
is seen moving Northeast in direction of sheets and that Crooks has a
10:16:24
backpack 2 minutes before the shooting while President Trump has been
10:16:30
allowed to take the stage people see Crooks laying on his
10:16:36
stomach in a sniper position on the roof and they're yelling he has a gun and
10:16:41
they are trying to alert law enforcement and Secret Service why was Crooks not shot by a
10:16:49
sniper by the snipers why was he allowed to be there as soon as the individual was
10:16:57
identified as a threat they were no no no no no no what do you consider to be a threat a man with a gun laying in a
10:17:03
sniper position a man that had a backpack a man that had a bicycle a man that had a
10:17:09
rangefinder at what point is he determined a threat an individual with a backpack is
10:17:17
not a threat an individual with a rangefinder is not a threat what about a man laying on a
10:17:25
building that has direct line of sight of President Trump with a gun that
10:17:30
people are screaming and pointing out is that a threat Miss cheel once that
10:17:36
individual was identified they were neutralized no they were neutralized
10:17:42
Cooks was neutralized after he shot President Trump in the face Miss cheel
10:17:47
is he only a threat once he fires the weapon as soon as the counter sniper
10:17:53
identified that individual they were able to neutralize them how were people in the crowd okay then let's just take
10:18:00
it this way people under your command did not consider him to be a threat yet people in the crowd knew he had a gun
10:18:07
and considered him to be a threat that means that you are a complete failure as
10:18:13
the Director of the Secret Service that people under your command don't perceive a man laying on a roof with direct line
10:18:20
to the president with a gun they don't perceive that to be a threat yet the people in the crowd do how is that
10:18:27
possible that's the last question but please answer the question M uh director I'm not certain at this time how the
10:18:34
information from the people in the crowd was relay to any law enforcement Personnel no you knew that everyone knew
10:18:41
the people there knew that there was a danger they knew there was a threat to president Trump and it was allowed to
10:18:48
happen with was there a standown order Miss cheel was there a conspiracy to kill President Trump absolutely not then
10:18:55
how did this happen and why are you still sitting here not turning in your letter of
10:19:01
resignation last question please answer and then I'll recognize Mr Pressley please answer that question that is what
10:19:06
we are investigating to determine we're we're waiting for your letter we are waiting for your letter of resignation
10:19:13
and you you really need to consider doing that before you leave today thank CH chair recognize Miss Presley from
10:19:20
Massachusetts thank you no one absolutely no one should fear
10:19:26
for their life at a political rally in a classroom in a faith house or in their
10:19:33
home we must do something about political violence in all its forms and
10:19:38
gun violence in all of its forms now director cheel you have noted
10:19:43
that numerous investigations are ongoing related to the Secret Service response and that we can expect a report in the
10:19:48
next 60 days with the election nearly 100 days away that is an unacceptable
10:19:54
timeline and it makes people less safe it also allows my colleagues across the
10:20:01
aisle Republicans additional time to spread dangerous
10:20:07
misinformation which also puts People In Harm's Way some Republicans have exploited this moment to continue to
10:20:13
attack progress towards racial Justice and gender equity in America disappointing but but not
10:20:19
surprising I hesitate to repeat their racist and sexist tropes but in summary
10:20:25
Republicans have wrongfully and shamefully stated that hiring women and
10:20:30
people of color hindered the response to the shooting now this is part and parcel
10:20:35
of Republican strategy to constantly attack necessary diversity equity and
10:20:41
inclusion efforts to undermine the contributions that women people of color
10:20:47
the disability community and others make to this country each and every day and it is disgraceful in the wake of gun
10:20:55
violence and tragic loss of life Republicans are ignoring Solutions like gun safety reform and instead trotting
10:21:02
out sexist tropes can't say I'm surprised I ask unanimous consent to
10:21:08
enter into the record reporting from CNN titled right-wing media figures blame
10:21:14
women in secret service and Dei for security failure in Trump shooting
10:21:21
without objection to order this article quotes members of Congress and others that plainly accuse Dei and the hiring
10:21:28
of women as a liability for the Secret Service women have been an integral part of the agency since
10:21:34
1971 and are held to the same standards as their male counterparts to use them as a scapegoat during a time of Crisis
10:21:43
is shameful and it is dangerously divisive in fact
10:21:49
based on recent publicly available demographic data of the agency the largest demographic groups among special
10:21:56
agents are white and male but to right-wing extremists the
10:22:02
truth doesn't matter the lies they tell to advance their anti-diversity agenda
10:22:08
which is a key theme throughout project 2025 will only make the American public
10:22:14
less safe and more divided and every day director chief
10:22:19
that you fail to give us answers they are given more oxygen to make their
10:22:25
baseless claims that women and people of color are responsible for tragic events
10:22:31
and that is dangerous too thank you and I yield my remaining time to ranking
10:22:36
member Rasin uh thank you to the distinguished gentle lady from Massachusetts and thank
10:22:42
you for those trenchant insights um I wanted to make the point that that you
10:22:50
were making and several of other members were making to bring it into sharp
10:22:55
relief here um the very same day that uh
10:23:00
Donald Trump uh narrowly escaped an assassination attempt um but an honored
10:23:08
firefighter was gunned down and killed and other people were injured there was another mass shooting that day uh just
10:23:15
several hours later in Birmingham Alabama four people killed and 10 wounded in a nightclub shooting and you
10:23:23
might think oh that's some kind of freakish coincidence not at all we have more than one mass shooting a day in
10:23:30
America they are so commonplace now that they are barely reported in the national news it's of course local news in
10:23:36
Birmingham Alabama that four people were killed and 10 other people were shot and
10:23:42
seriously wounded being treated at the hospital uh these things are a nightmare
10:23:48
for the families of the victims who've been killed for the families who have to
10:23:53
take care of people who've been seriously injured and wounded they are a major Financial drain publicly and
10:24:01
privately and yet we allow um AR-15s to be purchased with abandon promiscuously
10:24:10
all over the country people can just go out and get an assault weapon and the
10:24:15
distinguished General lady from Michigan was right we have a hearing when it affects the president of the United
10:24:21
States but on all the other days of the year we don't have a hearing about it and I think it is because of an honest
10:24:29
disagreement we have about the Second Amendment there are some people who think the Second Amendment means you've got the right to arm yourself with
10:24:36
whatever Weaponry you need to overthrow the government of the United States and we reject that as a false interpretation
10:24:43
of the Second Amendment and a false interpretation of the Constitution we can ban assault weapons we did it back
10:24:50
in 1994 it dramatically reduced these mass shootings and when that ban was lifted the mass shootings went up
10:24:56
through the roof again and we've shown it and so just like we're demanding real answers and real action from the Secret
10:25:04
Service let us demand real action and real answers from ourselves about the
10:25:11
nightmare of Mass Gun Violence which puts America into a category all its own
10:25:16
when you compare us to the countries in the European Union or Canada or other similarly situated countries there's
10:25:23
nothing like what we're going through so we've got to act on the Secret Service to protect ourselves against political
10:25:29
violence and we got to act as a Congress to protect ourselves against AR15 violence in America chair recognizes
10:25:36
Miss mlan from Michigan thank you uh Mr chairman and first of all I want to thank the Secret
10:25:42
Service agents those who work tirelessly to protect our presidents and specific
10:25:48
spe Al those agents who did not hesitate to jump in front of President Trump and
10:25:53
my heart goes out to the family um of the compur family and the people at the
10:25:59
rally who are still recovering um on the other hand the secret service has a
10:26:05
leadership problem and and it falls on you and although I appreciate your
10:26:11
Hollow words that the buck stops here I was actually hoping for some answers
10:26:17
director Cheeto you must answer to the American people if you want to stay in
10:26:24
charge it's it's really really simple you want to keep your job right
10:26:30
absolutely okay the best way to keep your job is to answer the questions not
10:26:36
play this shell game not sing The Slim Shady song wasn't me I I mean come on
10:26:43
how long did you prepare for this hearing I've been preparing for this
10:26:49

10:27:09
hair are you sure the color of your suit I'm just like tell the American people what are you sure of you don't even know
10:27:14
when you started preparing for the hearing I mean the biggest hearing of your life and you have no clue you can't
10:27:21
remember when you started preparing for this hearing can you understand why those words seem Hollow to the American
10:27:28
people who are supposed to entrust their faith in you I assure you the moment I received notification but you can't
10:27:35
remember you got little Alzheimer's dementia going I mean what you can't remember I have several active
10:27:41
investigations going on in an operational agency to run okay all right but you want to take accountability
10:27:47
right the Box stops with you right I am taking accountability super then let's start with trying to answer some
10:27:54
questions you keep referring to the FBI when asked how many shell casings were
10:28:00
on the roof you referred to the FBI when asked if there were explosive in the car
10:28:06
you referred to the FBI when asked if Crooks was acting alone you referred to the FBI see a common theme here I can go
10:28:12
on and on my question is who at the FBI should I speak
10:28:19
with wait for it wait for it the FBI is responsible for the criminal is there a
10:28:26
name I'm not certain I'm not certain all right here we go I'm not certain I don't
10:28:32
know let me ask a different question have you been in communication with the FBI yes I have with whom I speak with
10:28:40
the director and the deputy director okay and what have they shared with you about this investigation so I'll give
10:28:47
you an a an an opportunity to answer again did they share with you how many
10:28:53
shell casings were on the roof they have shared with me the evid did they share with you how many shell
10:29:01
casing were on the roof yes and okay how many were
10:29:07
there I would refer to the FBI for their investigation how many were there and their information that they need to
10:29:13
share in their investigation so they've shared the information with you you just W don't want to share the
10:29:20
information with us correct we have concurrent investigations that are going on so they have shared this information
10:29:27
with you you know the answer to the question you just refer refuse to answer
10:29:34
the question from the member of Congress who has subpoena you to be here is there a different answer to that question I
10:29:42
was always willing to come here and testify before this oversight hearing beautiful then let's do that let's let's
10:29:49
for once have your actions match your words so you've been in the in in
10:29:54
communication with the FBI you know the answers and you refuse to tell us the
10:30:00
answers so I will ask you again you know how many shell casings were on that roof
10:30:05
what is the answer to that question I think it's pertinent what is the answer
10:30:10
to that question I think it's pertinent to talk to you about the information that the
10:30:16
secret service has and that the Secret Service knows related I'm asking you an answer to the question if you're
10:30:23
supposed to be in charge if the buck stops with you how come you can't share
10:30:28
the answers what are you covering up what are you hiding my
10:30:34
friend I'm not covering anything El then why can't you answer a simple question I
10:30:39
would leave it to the criminal investigation to answer questions related to
10:30:44
that when when you talk to the FBI
10:30:50
and you asked them how many explos well let me ask you did you ask them how many explosives were on the roof did they
10:30:56
answer that question or in the car excuse me did they answer that question for you yes yes so you know the answer to
10:31:03
that question that my colleagues have asked you but again you refuse to give us the answers your playing this wasn't
10:31:10
me well I submit to you if you can't and it's not a can't
10:31:16
it's a won't not a can't it's not a I don't know it's a I choose not to answer
10:31:23
the question well let me tell you miss chedel if you're going to lead you need to lead if you want to be in charge then
10:31:31
answer the question or step aside and have someone with the courage and the guts to answer to the American people
10:31:38
the questions that they deserve answers to and with that I yield back chair now recognize Miss bobbert from Colorado
10:31:45
thank you Mr chairman I'm going to continue down that vein um you have been here sitting today director cheel uh
10:31:51
definitively able to dismiss erroneous uh information and speculation however
10:31:56
you are refusing to answer questions that we now know that you have the information for you are are saying that
10:32:05
you are wanting to answer questions that the uh secret service has information to Well ma'am you are the Secret Service
10:32:11
you are the director you have said that you are the best for the job so I'm
10:32:16
going to ask you some questions now now knowing that you do have answers from the FBI whom you have been passing the
10:32:23
buck to this entire day and um I'll start with something that you know maybe
10:32:29
the FBI doesn't know because it's has to do with you personally you said you spoke with President Trump after the
10:32:36
assassination attempt and I want to know did you apologize to him directly for
10:32:41
nearly having president Trump killed yes I did I appreciate that I
10:32:48
appreciate that you recognize that this was your failure now since the
10:32:53
assassination attempt you are under oath reminding you have you communicated with
10:32:59
anyone at the White House on an encrypted messaging app like
10:33:07
signal yes or no no no I have not are you willing to surrender your personal
10:33:12
phone for analysis uh if I am required to do so
10:33:18
okay um I will look into making that request because I would like to see your personal phone to see if you're
10:33:24
communicating over encrypted uh messaging apps have you um ever turned down enhanced security requests from
10:33:31
Donald Trump's detail um his special agent in charge Sean Karan you ever
10:33:36
turned that down no I have not have there been re as has your team has a secret service
10:33:45
maybe not you personally I believe as I mentioned earlier there are times when requests are made for you
10:33:52
have denied them they have been denied and a denial doesn't has the Trump campaign made request for additional
10:33:57
assets that have been denied denial doesn't mean vulnerability have there been additional
10:34:04
requests for enhanced security at Mar Lago uh we have made a number of
10:34:09
enhancements to you confirmed that there were bomb sniffing dogs that were provided you failed to confirm if there
10:34:15
were aerial security surveillance uh assets that were provided so yes or
10:34:20
no was that provided at the rally at the rally yes ma'am we had OverWatch provided at the
10:34:28
rally you've confirmed that the Assassin was identified as suspicious 57 minutes
10:34:33
prior to the shooting was the suspicious individual ever approached by an
10:34:42
agent was any contact ever made with him uh not to my knowledge is that the standard protocol for someone who is
10:34:49
identified as suspicious the protocol would be to
10:34:54
locate the individual and and you said that he was located two to five times approximately no I said that the
10:35:01
information was passed potentially somewhere between two to five he was never located by an agent to my
10:35:07
knowledge that individual was not located by an agent we have we have dozens of rally goers who have
10:35:13
identified him and not one agent on the ground there are many many many agents on the ground local law enforcement
10:35:18
Secret Service no one was able to identify him and have sights on and and see
10:35:24
him what I'm saying is that the agents that were on the ground at the time uh I
10:35:29
have no knowledge that they were able to uh interview him or was locate him thank you was was there um a local law
10:35:36
enforcement officer who approached the roof and saw the shooter uh and and saw
10:35:42
that he was present on the roof that is the information that has been shared with me have you spoke to that local law
10:35:48
enforcement officer no I have not are you going to it is part of a criminal investigation that the FBI is
10:35:55
interviewing those individuals were agents stationed on the
10:36:00
water tower no why that would not be something uh that
10:36:06
would be included in a security plan has a man who is reported to have
10:36:12
been present um wearing a gray suit who allegedly requested a photo of the Dead
10:36:17
body of the assassin on top of the AGR roof been
10:36:23
identified I don't have that information is that something that you've heard of no were ATF agents present at the
10:36:32
rally to attend or to work to work not to my knowledge how long did the counter
10:36:39
sniper have Crooks in his SN in his sights before the shooter open fire on
10:36:45
President Trump I don't have that specific timeline will you be able to tell us if he communicated with other
10:36:51
agents on what he was seeing through his sites once I have that information
10:36:57
absolutely because we need to know why he waited for multiple rounds to be fired at president Trump before the
10:37:05
threat was neutralized we need to know if he was given an order to hold fire
10:37:11
now it's um you've excused the roof of being um unmanned because of the slope
10:37:17
of the roof do you continue to assert the slope of the roof as a credible
10:37:22
reason for leaving this position undefended first I'll go back and
10:37:27
correct that there was no order to hold fire our agents and officers uh have the
10:37:34
ability to neutralize a threat at the time see it you know I'm sorry you don't know the communication that was taking
10:37:40
place or how long he had admitted sites because you haven't spoke to him but you do know that there was no order to hold
10:37:46
fire I can tell you the way that our Personnel are trained they are trained on the use of force scale that when they
10:37:51
see a threat they are authorized to neutralize that threat there is no they
10:37:57
don't have to ask for permission you excuse the roof being unmanned because
10:38:02
of the slope do you stand by that assertion the roof was not covered with
10:38:07
an individual on it because there was OverWatch provided apparently not no there was no
10:38:14
OverWatch rather maddening especially now knowing that you do have answers from the FBI who you have been passing
10:38:21
the buck to this entire hearing not answering a congressional hearing
10:38:27
members of Congress while you were under oath and under a subpoena I I find it maddening that the director um that that
10:38:34
our country has come centimeters away from Oblivion under your watch you have
10:38:40
answers you are refusing to give those to us it uh directing us to the FBI and
10:38:48
this entire thing is a waste of time you you are responsible for the loss of a
10:38:55
life and the shooting that took place on President Trump you do need to resign
10:39:00
this is bipartisan you need to be fired you do not need to hold this position you are not the best for this job I am
10:39:07
over my time but I I cannot tolerate your watch any longer and I'm going to continue to call daily for you to be
10:39:14
removed from your position ma'am chair recognize Mr from South Carolina thank you Mr
10:39:19
chairman director cheel how long have you been with the secret service 29 years right that's correct and how long
10:39:26
have you been director of The Secret Service just under two years during your tenure as director under the Secret
10:39:32
Service I know we're here today to talk about the assassination attemp attempt on President Trump but how many other
10:39:39
security lapses have occurred with protectees under your
10:39:45
watch I don't have a specific number but there have been uh some lapses there
10:39:50
have been other lapses was one of them Jake Sullivan yes sir what happened
10:39:55
there there was an individual who was able to access uh Mr Sullivan's
10:40:01
residence his residence a protecte somebody was able to break into his house and what happened did anyone get
10:40:08
fired because of that there were individuals who have been reassigned reassigned what other
10:40:15
what other steps have taken what I'm seeing what what other excuse me what other uh incidents have occurred other
10:40:20
than Jake Sullivan was there an issue with the
10:40:27
secret service agent and vice president Harris I would not call that a security
10:40:35
incident well it seems to me I mean you have security lapses with President Trump you have security lapses with Jake
10:40:41
Sullivan you have issues uh with your personnel related to vice president kamla Harris there seems to be repeated
10:40:47
theme here would you not agree with that I think that we are talking about separate categories of incidents well I
10:40:55
I would disagree with that I I think there's a repeated theme when you've got protectees and you're not you're not upholding your core Mission let me ask
10:41:01
you something else uh does the Secret Service routinely record Communications between and amongst
10:41:10
detail radio communications any communication email Communications are
10:41:17
uh captured as well as uh text messages and then depending on the detail uh
10:41:23
radio communications are recorded does the Secret Service have recorded Communications from the July 13th event
10:41:30
we do not have radio communications from that day but you have text messages we do have uh emails and text messages
10:41:36
emails okay great does the head of the uh Trump detail or someone else embedded in this detail have command
10:41:43
decision-making Authority or do they need to seek authorization from someone outside that detail the head of the
10:41:49
detail has uh the decision Mak Authority for things that are necessary for that detail is that standard for protection
10:41:55
details yes it is okay let me ask you something
10:42:01
um during campaign events is it common for the Secret Service to utilize other agencies yes it is what uh other
10:42:09
agencies would be providing assistance to the Secret Service uh there are a number of other agencies that uh provide
10:42:15
assistance to the Secret Service during campaigns uh we uh utilize Personnel from the Department of Homeland Security
10:42:22
we utilize Personnel from the Department of Defense uh and we utilize local law enforcement partners are you are you on
10:42:30
the same radios do you provide the radios to to all the assets that are taking part in protection of an event uh
10:42:37
we provide radios to the Personnel from the Department of Homeland Security that are assisting us but not local law
10:42:43
enforcement local law enforcement is working on their own radios are you you on the same
10:42:48
frequency we uh ensure that we have uh counterparts in the security room and so
10:42:54
the local law enforcement will place uh one of their personnel uh in the security room with our Personnel so that
10:43:01
we have interoperate interoperability Communications let me ask you something just about the timeline because I think
10:43:07
this is really interesting that we can't nail that down I mean I think there are lay people out there with more knowledge
10:43:13
about the timeline than you seem to come before a subpoena in front of Congress was Mr Kooks observed at the AGR
10:43:19
building prior to the shooting he was observed on the grounds
10:43:25
uh outside of our perimeter prior to the shooting at approximately what time was that you don't have to give me the
10:43:30
specific minute but at approximately what time was that I believe it was about 45 minutes or so prior to did did
10:43:37
the sniper the sniper team take a photo of Mr Crooks the the local team did yes so it
10:43:44
was a local team and not a secret service sniper that took the photo okay and did he relay that photo to Central
10:43:52
Command uh again it's an act of ongoing investigation so we I want to make sure
10:43:58
that I'm factual with the route that that photo took and who that was
10:44:04
disseminated to and when what time did the um did did the did Mr what when did
10:44:10
Mr crooks' status go from a suspicion a person that was uh Under Suspicion to a
10:44:15
threat when did that happen for and maybe not even a specific time
10:44:21
director Cheeto maybe a certain event that happened that transformed him from a su a person of Suspicion to a threat
10:44:28
when did that happen to the best of my knowledge based
10:44:34
on what I have been told thus far it's approximately five minutes to where uh
10:44:40
individuals relay that there was an incident being or an issue I'm sorry
10:44:46
being worked at the 3:00 of the president so that was but it was before
10:44:52
the shots were fired that is correct but again it was not uh phrased as a threat
10:44:58
it was just that something was being worked yeah but my question is when did he become Su when when did he transform
10:45:04
from suspicion to threat because they're treated very differently people can be suspicious but they're not a threat
10:45:10
until a certain point in time so when did that happen I believe that it was seconds uh before the guns the gunfire
10:45:17
started seconds my gosh we actually have a few questions that we got answered today listen I'm going to wrap up here
10:45:23
uh Mr chairman but here is the frustration that people have the buck stops with you you've said that yourself
10:45:30
but the problem in Washington DC it is the only town in America that you can be so bad at your job that you actually get
10:45:36
a promotion or don't get fired you have not been able to answer the number of Agents uh whether or not requests were
10:45:43
denied on additional security whether or not law enforcements were able to engage engaged before the shooting with the
10:45:49
Assassin how he got on the roof how the rifle got on the roof you can't tell us how many shots he fired whether the
10:45:54
casings were recovered you can't tell us anything about his cell phone you can't tell us uh whether the rally was
10:45:59
supposed to be postponed given the intelligence that was you were receiving you can't tell us whether the car had a
10:46:04
bomb you can't even tell us his motive and the American people are incredibly distrustful because it has taken nine
10:46:10
days to even get a cintilla of evidence out of you maybe if I was CNN or ABC or
10:46:16
NBC I would have gotten much more thorough and accurate information but we have not received that in a subpoena
10:46:23
Hearing in front of this Congress that is why the American people are frustrated and I Echo the bipartisan
10:46:29
calls on this committee and all across this country that you should resign or maybe when the president wakes up from
10:46:34
his nap he can fire you thank you Mr chairman chair now recognizes Miss Luna from Florida director shidel can you
10:46:40
please give me the names of the individuals who are in charge of your conop for the rally
10:46:47
I'm not going to release names can you give me the titles and how many individuals no we had a full Advance
10:46:54
Team that was responsible for Advan how many people are the final approval Authority there are a number of people
10:47:00
that are engaged in approving can you give me a number no I do not have a firm
10:47:05
number can you just confirm whether or not I understand this is an open investigation but but in order in order
10:47:11
to dispel conspiracy theorist have you guys been able to subpoena the shooters Discord records or has the FBI to your
10:47:17
knowledge I believe that the FBI is working on those okay is it factual to say that you have not ruled out that the
10:47:24
shooter was working with other people or persons again the FBI is conducting the criminal investigation into can you at
10:47:30
least in an effort to dispel conspiracy theories can you confirm or deny that at this time we do not have that there were
10:47:36
any other people engaged so you believe he's acting alone I do okay have you been made aware of multiple eyewitness
10:47:43
reporting that there was a sh a second shooter on a water tower I do not have any information related to
10:47:49
any second shooter okay uh the reason I asked that is because according to testimony from multiple Witnesses they
10:47:56
did report that and again I to my understanding there were over 40 sniper teams that were briefed by the butler
10:48:02
ESU and I want to make sure that people are aware if you're saying that there's not another shooter that we are able to
10:48:08
clear that information because from this whole entire briefing it doesn't seem like much information has been able to get out to the American people so I'm
10:48:14
trying to dispel rumors as I'm sure you understand um was it true that secret
10:48:20
service was present at the butler ESU briefing there was a briefing between
10:48:26
the uh counter sniper teams that were working on the ground pres yes to my
10:48:32
knowledge okay I want to read you report from people that seem to be throwing you under the bus and stated that they were
10:48:39
in attendance and that secret service was not in attendance at the security briefing according to individuals with
10:48:44
knowledge to also include that the AGR building where the shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks was located um was
10:48:51
actually not a part of their security perimeter for that so there was not Secret Service
10:48:58
present um it seems as though that when you were asked earlier from rep Christa
10:49:03
morthy about whether or not Secret Service was aware of a threat you had said no they were unaware of a threat
10:49:10
and yet according to Communications again from La law enforcement that were in some of these group chats they
10:49:16
actually had reported that secret service was made aware of a threat at around 5:59 p.m. as a part of the
10:49:23
command including Secret Service aware of messages and requests about in uh information about the suspect's location
10:49:31
can you please tell me if you have knowledge of that at all again I think we're conflating the T the difference
10:49:37
between the term threat and suspicious but you guys did have knowledge at 5:59
10:49:43
p.m. according to those group chats did you not of a suspicious individual okay
10:49:48
um chairman in my opinion According to some of the testimony today I feel that you have perjured yourself in some
10:49:55
instances and so I'm going to ask for a full review of the transcripts by staff and if you find that to be the case I do
10:50:00
ask that you bring perjury charges against the director um I will say this it is very frustrating and I've talked
10:50:07
to my colleagues and we've said it to your face that you have been up here basically stonewalling our ability to
10:50:13
get the answers to the American people and what I will also say is that every single member of Congress does not feel
10:50:18
safe with you in charge you have heard that and I think that we are all sitting ducks with you and directing the Secret Service currently but more importantly
10:50:25
it sends a message to our adversaries that we are not protected and we are one of the strongest countries in the world
10:50:31
so you have essentially made us a less safe country because of it um as a result of that I'm asking you to
10:50:36
formally step down I share my same opinions as my Democrat colleagues and I
10:50:41
also think that your efforts to bring forward a full um investig and report in
10:50:47
60 days is unacceptable and as a result of that I'm going to do everything in my legislative toolkit to ensure that that
10:50:53
happens sooner rather than later and I'm sure that you know that we brought a vote on inherent contempt against
10:50:59
Garland for essentially blocking a congressional investigation and I don't think that you should be any different so um I will say that I am just
10:51:06
completely disgusted by your performance today and I understand that you are probably in a position where you're
10:51:11
being told not to testify which is why we had to subpoena you I think that goes back to Garland but again is part of the
10:51:18
uh flushing that we need to get out of Washington and I would be happy to assist in that process chairman I yield the rest of my time chair now recognizes
10:51:25
Mr Langworthy from New York thank you very much Mr chairman and I appreciate you bringing this U hearing forward with
10:51:32
subpena uh director yesterday I made the decision to get my car and drive to
10:51:38
Butler Pennsylvania in preparation for this moment in in asking you questions about uh uh the events of of the
10:51:46
assassination attempt on President Trump's life uh i' I've done several presidential Advance uh events in Prior
10:51:52
in my career and I I wanted to see this site with my own two eyes because I don't believe the video footage tells
10:51:57
the whole story or looking at things on a diagram and I was absolutely appalled
10:52:03
when I went to the site when I saw the fact that I could have stood on the roof of that building the AGR building and
10:52:11
hit that Podium with a nineiron and I'm a lousy golfer and the fact that that was not included in the perimeter is a
10:52:18
complete dereliction of the duty of the US Secret Service I mean there are very few rooftops that needed to be secured
10:52:24
and the fact that secret service is they were putting a site plan in place did not think it was necessary to man those
10:52:33
rooftops you have completely walked away from your duties you had one job and that's to protect the future president
10:52:40
of United States or to protect all of the other protectees and president Trump is only
10:52:46
here today by God's grace because he had just something in him that made him turn
10:52:51
his head just slightly or we would be in a national period of morning right now and you have done nothing here today
10:52:58
I've Rewritten these questions like four times during your hearing and you have an answered a damn one of them you
10:53:04
haven't given any information you have hidden behind this FBI investigation and I think you should be ashamed of yourself because you have brought more
10:53:10
shame to your agency than I think that the assassination attempt has at this point this is literally the worst
10:53:16
performance I have ever seen in front of a congressional hearing I you have offered no reason for this committee
10:53:23
this body or the American people to trust you or the secret service today and you should resign uh you have said
10:53:30
that you've put new security measures in place after the assassination attempt can you tell us what those
10:53:36
are because the American people want to know that you're taking real corrective measures but today you've pointed to an
10:53:42
investigation investigation or not you still have a job to do with a zero fail Mission but so far there's been
10:53:48
absolutely no accountability and you've admitted that here today not one person's been suspended not one person's
10:53:54
been put on a desk meanwhile we've got the most contentious of elections in our
10:54:00
nation's history in protees are in danger because of incompetent leadership
10:54:06
not not the agents the agents piled on President Trump to protect his life
10:54:11
those are heroes but the administrators running your agency they're not right now they're not doing their jobs and you
10:54:18
certainly aren't doing the most appalling part of Saturday's events is the countless opportunities that secret service had to stop Crooks before he
10:54:25
even got on the roof at 3:00 Crooks raised suspicion by entering the rally with a rangefinder at 5:45 a cop with a
10:54:32
Beaver County Emergency Services Unit saw Crooks eyeballing the roof at the AGR International building and then at
10:54:39
555 Secret Service was warned of a suspicious person and identifies Crooks as a threat this was all before shots
10:54:46
were fired 15 minutes later director yes or no did local law enforcement alert
10:54:51
the Secret Service about Crook's Presence at the rally yes they
10:54:57
did the shooter came to attention of law enforcement almost an hour before President Trump went on stage law
10:55:03
enforcement alerted the Secret Service of the shooter over and over youve said there's a difference between a suspicious individual and a threatening
10:55:09
individual can you explain what the shooter needed to exemplify to be called a threat
10:55:17
so I'm not clear as to what identified him as suspicious to the individuals who
10:55:23
uh originally clarified him that way for the Secret Service for an individual to
10:55:29
be determined to be a threat that individual would have to be seen uh with a weapon or capable of doing some sort
10:55:36
of harm to our protectees I I I mean director an individual walking into a rally with a rangefinder scoping out an
10:55:43
unprotected rooftop and he reportedly flew a drone over hours before it sounds like a lot more than suspicious
10:55:49
especially at a presidential rally uh your operational lapses your resource management and poor judgment nearly
10:55:55
resulted in the assassination of President Trump I mean the D elction of Duty here is is just appalling the fact
10:56:02
that you haven't visited Butler uh is just maddening to me that you're not
10:56:08
taking this job seriously I you know many people here have called for your resignation I've introduced a resolution
10:56:14
here into this body that hopefully will get a vote this week calling on the president to fire you ma'am you have not
10:56:21
done your job you have put a two black eyes on your agency and you need to go
10:56:27
Mr chairman I yield back gentleman yields back chair now recognizes Mr Burleson from
10:56:33
Missouri director cheel um I just want to kind of get an idea of what you can
10:56:40
answer um because outside of what the FBI was responsible for you have full
10:56:47
responsibility for the Department of of secret service so the question is what
10:56:52
is the mission what is your what's who and who defines the mission our mission of the Secret
10:56:58
Service is to protect uh the president the vice president uh their immediate families uh presidential candidates the
10:57:06
former presidents and uh those by executive order and we also have an investigative Mission and and those are
10:57:12
well defined yes sir everyone within the agency understands the mission yes they do what about protocols and standards
10:57:19
who defines the protocols and standards we have a number of protocols and policies in place for uh the various uh
10:57:26
missions that we have so would would it be safe to say that you failed the mission the ultimate Mission I have
10:57:34
stated repeatedly here today that there was a failure what about specific failures within
10:57:40
protocols and and guidelines within the agency again and I am uh certain that
10:57:48
the investigation that is being conducted internally as well as the external investigation you said you said
10:57:53
earlier in the hearing that there was either a communication there was there was a there's errors in communication or
10:57:59
in operations could it be both in in both errors in operational
10:58:06
decisions and errors in Communications I think the investigation
10:58:11
potentially could uh identify both so I want to talk about Communications um
10:58:18
representative bobbert asked earlier about using encrypted apps that you said you've not used I guess signal um are
10:58:26
you have you used any encrypted app to communicate on from your personal
10:58:33
device I do on occasion uh use encrypted apps to
10:58:38
communicate uh so you use some form of an encrypted app to
10:58:43
communicate with with people within the federal government with local law
10:58:48
enforcement whom whom are you communicating using encrypted apps uh many times it's with colleagues and uh
10:58:56
and Associates so you're communicating with colleagues on a personal
10:59:01
device there are times that the Secret Service when we work uh internationally
10:59:07
uh with some of our partners that they don't have the same texting capability and you you're not able to do
10:59:13
that with your with your government issue def device uh recently we have
10:59:18
been able to uh install some of those apps on government devices okay um let's talk about some of
10:59:26
the things uh that we can get access to I'm actually shocked that you are using
10:59:32
your personal device um encrypted communication tools I think that that may be the most shocking thing that I've
10:59:38
heard today I didn't expect that you for you to say that
10:59:44
um the we have requested this committee has requested multiple documents this is
10:59:49
not you know in under the purview of the FBI this is under your purview we requested a complete list of all law
10:59:55
enforcement Personnel including Secret Service Department of Homeland Security local law enforcement with the roles and
11:00:01
protecting the president and we requested that to be for us to receive that by July 18th did we did you provide
11:00:09
that I believe that our agency is in the process of collecting all documents so you did not you have not provide
11:00:15
provided it how long does it take to determine who the the Personnel were that were on site we are collecting a
11:00:22
comprehensive list of all the documents that have been requested we also requested all the audio and video
11:00:28
recordings that your agency not the FBI but your agency has in possession
11:00:34
related to the event did we receive those have you provided those at all we are in the process of collecting all
11:00:40
documentation requested you're in the process but you have not um any memorandums or any internal
11:00:49
Communications related to the to the event you your we requested that you
11:00:54
provide that have you provided any of that we are in the process of collecting the information that has been requested
11:01:01
okay so when can we expect to receive these documents how long does it take to
11:01:08
to to determine who was on site who was who was being employed to be there to
11:01:13
protect the pre the former president uh when can we expect that how long how many days does it take to provide that
11:01:20
information we want to make sure that we have a comprehensive uh accounting of all of the documents uh that were
11:01:26
engaged in that day and we will make them available as soon as possible I think transparency is the key here it's
11:01:32
shocking to me that we are communicating in in a um encrypted app to colleagues
11:01:38
um I I almost certain that violates some federal laws I I would like to clarify
11:01:44
you didn't ask me whether my communication were uh government work related or whether they were personally
11:01:49
related you're communicating with colleages communicate uh government business with colleagues on a personal
11:01:56
device I communicate on my work device are you using an encrypted device on your work device I am not no no
11:02:02
encrypted apps no I do not okay thank you Mr chairman chair now recognize Mr
11:02:08
Waltz from Florida uh Madam director please I'd
11:02:14
like to direct your attention to this video and and I sincerely appreciate the clarity on this turn up the volume St I
11:02:20
just want to ask you because this has been this has popped up Republican Congressman Mike walls he said on social
11:02:26
media on Saturday and I'm going to read this for you because it does talk about you secretary I have very reliable
11:02:31
sources telling me that there have been repeated requests for stronger Secret Service protection for president Trump
11:02:37
denied by secretary mayorcas your department has already pushed back on that calling that absolutely false but
11:02:44
he is putting this on you can you respond to that please well that is yeah that's a that's
11:02:51
a a baseless and irresponsible statement and is one that is unequivocally
11:02:59
false director Cheeto did you speak with your boss uh secretary my
11:03:07
orcus you you fall under DHS did you speak with him on the 14th the day after
11:03:13
yes I did so you spoke with them before he made that statement I spoke with him uh the immediately follow did incident
11:03:21
did you inform him that all requests for additional
11:03:26
resources for president Trump had been fulfilled I or or that it was false to
11:03:32
say they had been denied I informed him that the request uh for that rally that
11:03:39
day had been fulfilled okay you're you continue to
11:03:44
answer that very carefully because I made a broader statement the agents that came to me made a broader statement that
11:03:50
is permanent protective detail for years now have been asking for more is that
11:03:57
correct I do not have specific incidents of those requests is it correct that
11:04:03
they've been asking for more I have heard the same reports that you have uh
11:04:09
without having them in front of me I am unable those requests are made in writing I mean the agents are telling me they make them in writing this this
11:04:15
isn't a verbal agency things are made in writing I understand what you're saying I don't have those requests in front of
11:04:21
me here to I'm not asking if you have them in front of you are you aware that they were made as I said earlier there
11:04:26
are times when requests are made and depending on the availability of assets or if there is a way that that so there
11:04:32
were times when they were denied if there is a way that that uh vulnerability can be mitigated in a
11:04:38
different way then that is why the there are times when they were denied for a
11:04:43
variety of reasons that is why the Secret Service has a multi-layered and multifaceted security plan so that we
11:04:49
can pivot if we so in the wake I mean in the immediate 48 Hours of an
11:04:54
assassination attempt on a former president could be the next leader of the Free World almost had his head blown
11:05:01
off your boss says that's irresponsible and false to say things are denied and
11:05:06
you had talk to him so did he just make that on his own make that up on his own or did you tell him that we were
11:05:12
speaking about the requests made at the rally uh staff can we show the next
11:05:19
slide please then we have your spokesman did you sign off on this
11:05:25
statement that there's an assertion that a member of the former president's team requested additional security resources
11:05:32
and those were rebuffed this is absolutely false in fact we added Pro
11:05:37
protective resources and technology and capability as part of the increased campaign travel Tempo but next slide
11:05:44
please next SL please stf we have the
11:05:50
Washington Post article that then says we now have senior Secret Service
11:05:56
officials saying there were in times at times when it was denied so which is it
11:06:03
again there have been a number of conversations going on here did you sign off on that spokesman's statement the spokesman's statement I believe was
11:06:09
related to requests that were made for did you sign off on it for the requests that were made at the rally did you sign
11:06:15
off on the statement before it went out I sign off on my press spokesman statement before they go out I would hope you would in the wake of an
11:06:21
assassination attempt yes you did categorically false that any
11:06:27
requests were made you signed off on it thank you for that uh thank you for that
11:06:34
Clarity Madam director how many press conferences have you held since the assassination attempt we have put out uh
11:06:41
press releas how many press conferences have you held gone to the mic taken questions from from the public from the
11:06:47
media how many I have not held any how many has your how many has secretary
11:06:52
mayorcas held I don't zero how many has the FBI
11:06:57
held zero how many has the Department of Justice
11:07:03
held I know you know the answer I believe there was a press
11:07:08
conference uh in Butler uh after the incident occurred by local law enforce
11:07:17
not by you and not by the Department of Homeland Security so this is how
11:07:22
misinformation flies I mean in the darkness in the absence of information
11:07:28
now we have nine days later before a congressional committee we all represent almost a million people and you still
11:07:34
don't have answers are you aware that national news anchors are saying this was a hoax on National Television they're
11:07:41
saying no the president wasn't shot it was flying glass are you aware of that I have not heard those reports are you
11:07:47
aware that I mean there are rumors rampant online that there were multiple Shooters yes are you aware that
11:07:54
because the shooter had overseas encrypted Platforms in Belgium and New Zealand and in Germany that a lot of
11:08:02
people are speculating there could have been foreign involvement logically are you aware of that yes and did have you
11:08:08
done anything to disabuse any of these Notions today no you haven't
11:08:16
D Madam director I would fire you regardless of the failure I would fire
11:08:21
you just how you've handled it since you should have been the first to the mics to say America world I want to assure
11:08:28
you we're going to get to the bottom of this I want to assure you full transparency uh our agency clearly had
11:08:33
major gaps here and I want to personally take responsibility and accountability
11:08:38
you should have been the first standing alongside secretary secretary my orcus
11:08:44
and I would even go so far as to say have daily press conferences updating
11:08:49
everyone on what we know but you haven't had any of that what are you hiding behind I am not hiding because you're
11:08:56
making the situation worse I think you've heard that on a bipartisan basis here you are making this situation far
11:09:03
worse in the absence of information um let's move
11:09:08
on this is truly astounding I want to be clear because you keep dodging the issue
11:09:14
has president president Trump's permanent protective detail requested additional assets over the last few
11:09:21
years he is clearly not your average former president he's not Jimmy Carter in an old folks home he's not President
11:09:27
Bush painting uh out in his barn he has multiple residences a lot of rallies
11:09:34
he's very publicly engaged and he has a foreign threat in addition to domestic
11:09:39
threats have they requested additional resources that's the last question but please feel free to thank you director
11:09:46
we have continued as I stated earlier to increase uh over the past year uh the
11:09:52
assets that are at the former president's residence and uh supplied to his detail Mr chairman if I could just
11:09:58
ask for one more Indulgence it is clear you'd have not been to Butler Pennsylvania leaders lead and should be
11:10:04
on the ground you have not been there instead you went to the RNC but you weren't originally even
11:10:10
going to go there where were you originally scheduled to go besides the RNC a national special security event
11:10:16
I was always scheduled to go to uh Mr chairman I would like to enter into the record that the director was scheduled
11:10:22
to go to Aspen hobnobbing around with I don't I don't know who what liberal
11:10:27
Elites go to Aspen that was where you originally scheduled to go to speak at a forum I was scheduled to go to the RNC I
11:10:34
was going to leave the RNC for 24 hours and return back to the
11:10:40
RNC I hope as your predecessor Julie Pearson with a security incident on the
11:10:46
White House and under the Obama Administration and Reagan SEC Secret Service detailed lead I will hope you
11:10:52
would have the dignity for the sake of the agents in the service to resign gentlemen's time's expired thank you
11:10:59
like to enter a few things into the record uh first of all the remaining articles that Mr Bigs was uh wanting to
11:11:06
enter into the record without objection to ordered next I have a written statement from representative Mike Kelly
11:11:13
of Pennsylvania his District uh includes Butler H and
11:11:20
uh he has a written statement that we'd like to enter into the record without objection so ordered a bipartisan 114th
11:11:27
Congressional report titled United States Secret Service and agency in crisis this was prepared by former
11:11:33
oversight committee chairman Jason chaitz and former ranking member Elijah cumins and lastly uh the issue
11:11:40
subpoenaed compelling director cheo's appearance at today's hearing without objection so ordered that concludes uh
11:11:49
our question segment I want to thank the director for your testimony today I now
11:11:55
yield to the ranking member for closing remarks thank you very much Mr chairman
11:12:01
um and director Cheeto also want to thank you for your your patience um over
11:12:07
the course of what must have been a very long and trying uh uh hearing for you uh
11:12:14
it has been an unusually encouraging hearing and an unusually depressing hearing and what's encouraging Mr
11:12:21
chairman is that we came together to issue a strong statement deploring and categorically denouncing political
11:12:29
violence in America and I also didn't see any daylight between the members of
11:12:34
the two parties today at the hearing in terms of our bafflement and outrage about the shocking operational failures
11:12:42
that led to disaster in year catastrophe on July 133
11:12:48
2024 uh what is depressing is the extraordinary Communications gap between
11:12:53
the director of The Secret Service and Congress um and I don't want to add to
11:13:00
the directors uh Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day um but I I will be
11:13:07
joining the chairman in uh calling for the resignation of the director just
11:13:13
because I think that this relationship is um irretrievable at this point and I
11:13:18
think that uh the director has lost the confidence of Congress um at a very
11:13:24
urgent and tender moment in the history of the country and we need to very quickly move Beyond this but what I will
11:13:31
say Mr chairman is that I took this hearing to be about two major policy
11:13:37
failures and one policy failure is the one that got the vast majority of the attention which was the failure of the
11:13:43
Secret Service to to um effectively respond to uh a gunman on a roof within
11:13:51
uh 150 yards of a presidential visit and
11:13:57
speech um but the other failure is on the part of Congress because the mass
11:14:03
shooting that took place in Butler Pennsylvania um is replicated all over
11:14:09
the country every day and in fact as I said Mr chairman it happened that
11:14:14
evening um in Alabama in Birmingham Alabama where there was a mass shooting where
11:14:20
more people even were killed and wounded than were killed and wounded in Butler Pennsylvania so it's true the president
11:14:27
the former president the handful of people who get the Secret Service protection are the only people in
11:14:32
America we thought were safe from an AR-15 attack it's clear that they're not
11:14:38
safe either and we got to get to the bottom of that but we also have to get to the bottom of the larger problem
11:14:44
which is that the whole country is living like this in fear and in Terror
11:14:49
of assault weapon attacks in movie theaters churches synagogues mosques
11:14:55
supermarkets Walmarts um you know any place where an
11:15:01
audience or a public gathers and um the worst was in Las Vegas where a gunman
11:15:07
got up on a roof and then just uh mowed down 60 people uh below him and wounded
11:15:14
hundreds and hundreds of other people so we've got to deal with that problem we yes we've got to
11:15:19
move as swiftly as we can to deal with the problems of the Secret Service but the broader problem is still there and I
11:15:28
just wish to uh the heavens that our colleagues that could get together on
11:15:34
the question of presidential security against an AR-15 attack could
11:15:40
get together on the question of public security against an AR-15 attack because
11:15:46
all of us are vulnerable all of our families are in danger by this and the rest of the world doesn't live this way
11:15:53
and we have to look to see how uniquely strange it is that we allow 20year olds
11:15:58
to access AR-15s weapons of mass destruction and show up in public places
11:16:04
to endanger other people and I hope Mr chairman we can work together on that with the same Spirit of bipartisan
11:16:12
commitment to the public safety that was exemplified here today and I yield back to you uh Rec member yields back uh I'll
11:16:19
deliver my closing remarks director cheel I subed you to appear today to get
11:16:24
answers for the American people about the failures that led to the assassination attempt of President
11:16:30
Donald J Trump unfortunately you refused to answer
11:16:36
today and this committee is not known for uh its bipartisan his model of
11:16:43
bipartisanship but I think today we came together unanimously in
11:16:49
our disappointment for your lack of answers uh you've stated that the the
11:16:56
FBI will investigate and and give a report and you estimate 60 days we've
11:17:01
been waiting for months and months for lots of different uh bits of information
11:17:08
from the FBI we have no confidence in the FBI the majority of this committee has no confidence in the FBI I sincerely
11:17:17
hoped that the hearing today would give not just Congress confidence in the
11:17:23
Secret Service but the American people would have confidence in the Secret
11:17:30
Service we don't have confidence not just in Congress I don't believe the American people tonight when they go to
11:17:36
bed are going to have confidence that the Secret Service is is the best it can be at
11:17:44
protecting President Biden at protecting the first lady at Protecting President Trump at protecting their families
11:17:51
that's what the primary role for the Secret Service should be and some people have said and speculated well there
11:17:57
needs to be more money and more employees as I stated early on 3.1
11:18:02
billion I believe next year it's going to be $3.2 billion budget over 8,000
11:18:08
employees if the Secret Service is spread too thin and doing things like uh inspecting counterfeit which is what the
11:18:15
secret service was created to do was to to inspect counterfeit money and things like that with the treasury if it spread
11:18:21
to thin then we need to come together in Congress and I think we can do that in a in a bipartisan way to narrow the focus
11:18:28
of the Secret Service to protect the leaders of our country to protect our
11:18:35
elections by protecting our our candidates and I don't believe we have any confidence that that you can do that
11:18:42
as the leader of the FBI I I I sincerely hope that we would adjourn this
11:18:48
Committee hearing and have confidence not just in in in the Secret Service but in in in you as director of The Secret
11:18:56
Service but we but we do not taking
11:19:02
responsibility requires a lot of things it means providing transparency uh it means uring simple
11:19:09
questions it means providing a specific timeline of July 13th to this committee and the American people I mean it's been
11:19:15
nine days there were people that uh were demanding that we have a hearing the the next day or or two days following the
11:19:22
the shooting and I said no we need to give the Secret Service ample time to be
11:19:28
able to answer those questions nine days nine days and I don't think we answered
11:19:35
very many questions that the American people have I don't think there was a qu I've never said this before and I've presided over a lot of hearings I don't
11:19:41
think there was one question asked by anyone that that the average American hasn't
11:19:48
already asked at a diner or at church or at a ball game the American people have
11:19:54
questions they deserve answers Congress deserves answers you were subpoenaed today to provide answers and ma'am you
11:20:01
did not do that so as as ranking member Rasin
11:20:08
stated he and I will be sending a letter uh requesting that you submit your
11:20:13
resignation as a step step toward accountability in uh in what happened
11:20:18
and one of the biggest frustrations that many of us have especially on this side of the a is that there's never
11:20:25
accountability in this Administration when you look at the at the debacles prior to July 13th I mean it would be
11:20:32
hard to beat the withdrawal in Afghanistan the debaca there and no one was held accountable to this day no one
11:20:38
has been held accountable for that but here we have clearly video showing
11:20:44
people notifying the police and the police are blaming the Secret Service the Secret Service are blaming the
11:20:50
police Homeland Security is blaming everybody but at the end of the day
11:20:56
after this hearing and after our request for information we don't have any
11:21:02
answers for the American people and we don't have that confidence that you can lead the Secret Service to restore the
11:21:13
confidence
11:21:43
e e
11:22:26

11:29:03
today without objection the chair May declare a recess at any time I now uh recognize myself for the
11:29:10
purpose of making an opening statement but first
11:29:16
without objection uh representative Mills of Florida and representative Miller of Ohio are waved on to the
11:29:22
committee for the purpose of questioning the witness at today's hearing without objection to
11:29:28
order good morning today's hearing is for the American people who are seeking answers about the attempted
11:29:35
assassination of President Trump a little over a week ago American wa Americans watched in horror as a shooter
11:29:42
attempted to assassinate president Donald J Trump at a campaign rally in Butler Pennsylvania the gunman nearly
11:29:49
succeeded the bullet that struck president Trump's head was less than an inch from taking his life president
11:29:56
Trump survived but one rally goer Corey comparator tragically did not two others
11:30:05
were seriously injured it was a horrifying moment in American history the horror was exceeded only by The
11:30:11
Bravery of the law enforcement agents who threw them El In Harm's Way when shots were fired The Bravery of a crowd
11:30:18
unwavering in its refusal to panic and The Bravery of a bloody president Trump
11:30:24
refusing to run while we give overwhelming thanks to the individual Secret Service agents who
11:30:31
did their jobs under immense pressure this tragedy was
11:30:36
preventable the secret Services protective mission is to protect us en
11:30:41
visiting world leaders and safe Safeguard us elections through protection of candidates and
11:30:48
nominees the secret service has a zero fail Mission but it failed on July 13th
11:30:54
and in the days leading up to the rally the secret service has thousands of
11:31:00
employees and a significant budget but it has now become the face of
11:31:06
incompetence the committee has a long track record of providing oversight of the Secret Service our predecessors both
11:31:14
Jason chaitz and Elijah Cummings among others worked together to issue warnings and recommendations to address obvious
11:31:21
shortcomings in the agency's makeup and operations unfortunately those warnings
11:31:27
and recommendations have gone unheeded a former president and current
11:31:32
candidate for president was shot in the head by a sniper within 500 feet of the
11:31:38
podium this is unacceptable and we are concerned the Secret Service lacks the
11:31:43
proper management to keep protectees safe from Bad
11:31:48
actors Americans demand answers but they have not been getting them from the Secret Service we are instead learning
11:31:56
about new facts about the events surrounding the attempted assassination
11:32:01
every day from whistleblowers and leaks Americans demand accountability
11:32:08
but no one is yet to be fired for this historic failure today's Witness secret service
11:32:14
director Kimberly cheel is here under subpoena to answer questions about how
11:32:20
the agency failed president Trump and the victims who attended the rally in Butler
11:32:26
Pennsylvania it is my firm belief director cheel that you should
11:32:31
resign however in complete Defiance director cheel has maintained she will not tender her resignation therefore she
11:32:37
will answer questions today from members of this committee seeking to provide Clarity to the American people about how these events were allowed to transpire
11:32:45
we will ask these questions because the Secret Service and its parent agency the Department of Homeland Security have
11:32:52
been unwilling to provide answers to the American people DHS has sought to push
11:32:57
this hearing to a different time secret service has suggested the hearing occur without media presence and both agencies
11:33:05
have provided only shallow explanations to Congress about what happened on July
11:33:11
13th indeed DHS and secret Services lack of communication with the oversight
11:33:16
committee required me to issue a subpoena compelling director cheel to
11:33:21
attend today and still DHS requested compelling director to attend today and
11:33:27
still DHS requested more time to prepare in the agency's make shouldn't take this much time or Preparation those warnings
11:33:34
recomendations I thankful to the ranking member Mr Rasin for joining me candidate president sh the
11:33:45
but that does not matter today this the safety of secret service protectees is not based on their political affiliation
11:33:52
and the bottom line is that under director Kel's leadership we question whether anyone is safe not President
11:34:00
Biden not the first lady not the White House and certainly not the presidential
11:34:05
candidates the July 13th assassination attempt is one of the darkest days in American political history it represents
11:34:13
the ugliest parts of what American politics has become hatred of each other
11:34:18
and a dangerous turn to extremism before we were Republicans Or democrats we are Americans if we place
11:34:26
our political affiliations above our duty and love of country we cannot maintain a country we must ensure our
11:34:32
Republic is strong and our Republic cannot be strong when our leadership our elections our institutions and our
11:34:39
candidates are threatened by extremism and violence today director cheetah will
11:34:46
answer questions about why she deserves to continue to play a critical role in preserving this country's safety and at
11:34:52
the very least what led to the catastrophic deadly events on July 13th
11:34:58
in Butler Pennsylvania again I do not believe director Ketel deserves to maintain her position as head of the Secret Service
11:35:05
but members of the America and the American people will make their own decisions based on her answers today I
11:35:11
urge director cheel to be transparent and for coming in her testimony today Americans deserve no less we have a duty
11:35:20
to find out how this happened and to ensure it never happens again I now
11:35:26
yield to ranking member Rasin for his opening statement thank you kindly chairman comr uh Elijah Cummings whose
11:35:33
beautiful Visage looks down upon us taught us that the way to find common ground in a crisis is to look for the
11:35:40
higher ground and last week chairman comr and I came together to reach for that Higher Ground we made a joint
11:35:46
statement condemning the mass shooting and assassination attempt against former president Trump as a grave assault on
11:35:53
our democracy as we wrote We are united in condemning all political violence I
11:35:59
join the good chairman in expressing condolences to the family of Corey comparator and in sending healing wishes
11:36:06
to the wounded victims also of this atrocious act of violence some are
11:36:12
calling it a miracle that former president Trump escaped this AR-15 attack unlike so many thousands of our
11:36:19
fellow citizens who have been killed or seriously wounded in other AR-15
11:36:24
shootings whether this miracle is of Divine Providence or of an adventitious nature will be up to each of us to
11:36:31
ponder but our job in Congress is not simply to Marvel at Miracles or count on good luck but to act as public policy
11:36:39
legislators to do whatever we can to prevent future po political violence
11:36:44
attempted assassinations and mass shootings the chairman and I are thus determined to get to the bottom of the
11:36:50
stunning security failures that enabled this 20-year-old lone gunman who
11:36:55
borrowed his father's AR-15 to perpetrate a mass shooting and assassination attempt at an event
11:37:01
protected by the Secret Service as well as state and local police we'll ask hard
11:37:06
questions of director CH today in order to identify and understand the shocking
11:37:12
security failures that occurred and to help transform the operations of the Secret Service to prevent anything
11:37:18
like this from happening again but we can't let ourselves off the hook either dear colleagues what happened in Butler
11:37:24
Pennsylvania was a double failure the failure by the Secret Service to properly protect former president Trump
11:37:30
and the failure of Congress to properly protect our people from Criminal gun violence we must therefore also ask hard
11:37:37
questions about whether our laws are making it too easy for potential assassins to OB Ain Firearms generally
11:37:45
in the AR-15 specifically Mr comparator former president Trump and the other
11:37:50
rally attendees wounded and Butler are now members of a club no one wants to belong to the thousands of people who
11:37:56
have fallen victim to mass shootings last year we had 655 mass shootings in America defined as
11:38:04
four or more people being shot or killed in a single event not including the shooter 712 people died and nearly 2700
11:38:12
people were wounded in these attacks in 2023 mass shootings are commonplace they
11:38:17
happen at political rallies and constituent meetings in our elementary schools middle schools and high schools
11:38:23
in churches synagogues and mosques and movie theaters and parades and nightclubs and grocery stores in
11:38:29
concerts and on street corners here are the worst mass shootings in the last uh
11:38:36
11 or 12 years the list is a grim reminder of the horrific damage and
11:38:41
death wrought by assault weapons in the AR-15 in particular that have taken the lives of our children parents colleagues
11:38:49
and neighbors this is a a a very partial list mass shootings have become so
11:38:55
frequent that we don't even hear about them anymore since the mass shooting in Butler there have already been at least
11:39:02
10 additional mass shootings in America Two of which took place the same day
11:39:08
that former president Trump was targeted one of the mass shootings on that
11:39:13
violent Saturday July 13th happened at 11:00 p.m. at a nightclub in Birmingham Alabama where
11:39:19
four people were shot dead and 10 others wounded this means amazingly that the butler attack was not even the deadliest
11:39:27
mass shooting to happen in America on that day a weapon that can be used to
11:39:32
commit a mass shooting in an event under the full protection of the Secret Service together with dozens of state
11:39:38
and local police is obviously an intolerable threat to the rest of us who do not receive such protection and
11:39:45
obviously does not belong in our communities it's time to pass Universal background checks and build on this
11:39:51
administration's work to ensure that we permanently close the loopholes in The Brady Law for gun show purchases online
11:39:57
purchases and Private Sales to prevent those weapons from getting into the hands of people we know to be a threat
11:40:04
to others what happened in Butler shows why even closing these loopholes however
11:40:10
will not keep assault weapons out of the hands of potential assassins and mass murderers under federal law and in the
11:40:16
vast majority of States even young people not old enough to buy a beer legally can legally purchase and own the
11:40:23
AR-15 and carried in public the shooter and Butler used his father's AR-15 we
11:40:29
have to find the courage and resolve to pass a ban on the AR-15 and other assault weapons a ban is Broad support
11:40:35
even the New York Post loudly endorsed such a ban in 2019 we have passed an assault weapons
11:40:42
ban before 4 Republicans and Democrats together passed it in 1994 alas in 2004
11:40:50
we allowed the ban to expire we know this weapons ban worked one study found
11:40:55
that in the decade that followed the Ban's lapse mass shootings went back up
11:41:01
183% and deaths from mass shootings went up 239 per. but even as we change the
11:41:07
Secret Service and act to ban weapons of war like the AR-15 we still will have fallen short of of our duty if we fail
11:41:14
to denounce every instance of politically motivated violence in whatever form it takes Republicans and
11:41:20
Democrats again have come together to denounce this assassination attempt just as we did the Violent attempts on the
11:41:26
lives of our colleagues representative step scales and representative Gabby gords and on Paul Pelosi the husband of
11:41:34
speaker Nancy Pelosi who was attacked and brutalized in his home and in the immediate aftermath of the January 6th
11:41:40
Mass violence waged against Congress and the vice president and the Constitutional transfer power Democrats
11:41:46
and Republicans alike including Senator McConnell chairman comr and other colleagues all denounced this violent
11:41:53
assault on our democracy that wounded approximately 140 officers from the US
11:41:59
capital police and the Metropolitan Police Department and I commend them for
11:42:04
acting to uh denounce that attack just as Democrats moved swiftly to denounce
11:42:10
the attack on Congressman kiss scalise police scientists political scientists tell us that authoritarian
11:42:18
attacks on Democratic institutions begin with political parties refusing to disavow or openly embracing political
11:42:25
violence we have to reject that on a strong bipartisan basis as chairman comr and I have done even as we ensure our
11:42:31
secret service is up to its vital task of protecting presidents and candidates and as we work to ensure that America
11:42:38
the streets of our country are free from the violence of weapons of war thank you Mr chairman I yield back to you thank

11:44:42
opportunity to appear before you today the assassination attempt of former president Donald Trump on July 13th is
11:44:49
the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades and I
11:44:55
am keeping him and his family in my thoughts I would like to offer my sincerest condolences to the family of
11:45:01
Corey comparator a former Fire Chief and a hero who was killed in this senseless
11:45:06
shooting I would also like to acknowledge those who were injured in Butler David Dutch and James Copenhagen
11:45:13
and I wish them a speedy recovery I would be remiss if I did not also extend my condolences on the passing of your
11:45:19
colleague congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee Miss Jackson Lee was always engaged in the oversight of the Secret Service
11:45:26
and her passing is a great loss to this body the secret service's solemn mission
11:45:32
is to protect our nation's leaders on July 13th we failed as a director of the
11:45:38
United States Secret Service I take full responsibility for any security lapse of
11:45:44
our agency we are fully cooperating with ongoing investigations we must learn what
11:45:50
happened and I will move Heaven and Earth to ensure that an incident like July 13th does not happen again let me
11:45:58
State unequivocally nothing I have said should be interpreted to place blame for this
11:46:04
failure on our federal state or local law enforcement Partners who supported the Secret Service in Butler we could
11:46:11
not do our job without them we rely on the relationships built over years of working together to secure events and
11:46:18
conduct investigations our agents officers and support Personnel understand that every
11:46:24
day we are expected to sacrifice Our Lives to execute a no fail
11:46:29
Mission as witnessed on July 13th our special agents shielded former president
11:46:35
Trump with their own bodies on stage while shots were being
11:46:40
fired selflessly willing to to make the ultimate sacrifice without hesitation I
11:46:46
am proud beyond words of the actions taken by the former president's detail the counter sniper team who neutralized
11:46:52
the gunman and the Tactical Team who was prepared to act I will be transparent as
11:46:58
possible when I speak with you understanding though at times that I may be limited in providing a thorough
11:47:04
response in this open setting due to Associated risks with sharing highly
11:47:09
sensitive protective methodologies I do not want inadvertently provide you today with inaccurate
11:47:16
information since January 1st 2024 the secret service has successfully secured
11:47:21
over 7,500 sites every protective Advance comes with its own set of challenges and requires a customized
11:47:28
mitigation strategy including specific assets security plans are multi-layered
11:47:33
providing 360 degrees of protection these layers include Personnel Technical
11:47:40
and tactical assets which are Force multiplier for our protective posture
11:47:46
during every Advance we attempt to strike a balance between enabling the protected to be visible and our
11:47:52
protective requirements to be secure I know this because I have spent 29 years
11:47:58
in this agency I came up through the ranks I've secured events for every president since President Clinton
11:48:04
supervised on vice president Cheney detel LED our training center oversaw all of the investigations and protective
11:48:11
visits in the state of Georgia supervised on Vice President Biden's detail and the agency's entire
11:48:18
protective Mission during the Trump Administration the comprehensive advaned process involves collaborative planning
11:48:24
between our secret service the protectees staff local law enforcement partners and the level of security
11:48:31
provided for the former president increased well before the campaign and has been steadily increasing as threats
11:48:39
evolve the security plan included a full assessment of the Butler Farm Show showgrounds to identify security
11:48:46
vulnerabilities and craft a security plan for the protecte attendees and the
11:48:51
public immediately following the assassination attempt I directed the activation of my crisis center I
11:48:58
assembled my executive team to begin surging more protective resources to the former president and to ensure the
11:49:03
wellness of our people post incident all while securing an active crime scene I immediately ordered a re-evaluation of
11:49:10
the Republican National Convention security plan and I increased the security posture in the national capital
11:49:15
region for all permanent protectees and sites at the same time I initiated a
11:49:20
mission Assurance investigation within our agency I have instructed my team that all necessary resources will be
11:49:27
dedicated to investigating these manners we will not rest until we have explored
11:49:32
every option and we will leave no stone unturned but I want to be clear I am not
11:49:38
waiting for these investigations to be completed prior to making changes over the past two weeks we successfully
11:49:45
led the planning and execution of the 75th NATO Summit and the Republican National Convention over the next few
11:49:51
months we will Implement security plans for the Democratic National Convention the United Nations General Assembly and
11:49:56
have already begun planning and coordinating the 20125 inauguration it is now more important
11:50:01
than ever for the men and women of the Secret Service to remain resilient and to focus on what is necessary to carry
11:50:08
out our critical Mission our agency needs to be adequately resourced in order to serve our current Mission
11:50:14
requirements and anticipate future requirements the Secret Service currently protects 36 individuals on a
11:50:20
daily basis as well as world leaders who visit the United States like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who
11:50:27
arrived in Washington DC today the coming years will bring an unprecedented heavy protection Tempo I have no doubt
11:50:34
that the processes that I have impl implemented during my tenure as director in addition to my nearly 30 years of
11:50:40
experience in this agency have position the Secret Service to be stronger our
11:50:45
mission is not political it is literally a matter of life and death and the tragic events on July 13th remind us of
11:50:53
that I have full confidence in the men and women of the Secret Service they are worthy of our support and executing our
11:50:59
protective Mission I will now answer any questions that the committee may have
11:51:05
thank you very much director cheel we now begin our our five minutes uh questions and I will
11:51:10
begin just for the record the secret service has an annual budget of around
11:51:15
$3.1 billion doll and I believe around 8,000 employees is that correct yes sir
11:51:23
obviously there were many security failures on the day of the attempted assassination and leading up to that day
11:51:28
let's start with the building that the shooter used to shoot president Trump from at any point Saturday did the
11:51:34
Secret Service have an agent on top of that roof sir I'm sure as you can imagine
11:51:41
that we are just nine days out from this uh incident and there's still an ongoing
11:51:46
investigation and so I want to make sure that any information that we are providing so you can't okay why did the
11:51:53
Secret Service not can you answer why the Secret Service didn't place a single agent on the roof we are still looking into the
11:52:00
advanced process and the decisions that were made okay okay let's wasn't that
11:52:06
building within the perimeter that should be secured do we agree with that
11:52:12
the building was outside of the perimeter on the day of the visit but again that is one of the things that
11:52:18
during the investigation we want to take a look at and determine whether or not other decisions should have been made
11:52:24
one of the things that you said I believe in an interview that there wasn't an agent on the roof because it
11:52:30
was a slope roof is that is that normal and do you fear that that immediately
11:52:36
creates an opportunity for future wouldbe assassins to look for a slanted roof I mean it it this is a huge
11:52:43
question that every American has why wasn't a secret service agent on the roof and there have been reports that
11:52:50
agents were supposed to be on the roof but it was hot that day and they didn't want to be on the roof can you answer any of those questions director so I
11:52:57
appreciate you asking me that question chairman uh I should have been more clear in my answer when I spoke about
11:53:02
where we place Personnel in that interview uh what I can tell you is that uh there was a plan in place to provide
11:53:09
OverWatch and we are still looking into responsibilities and who was going to provide OverWatch uh but the Secret
11:53:16
Service in general not speaking specifically to this incident when we are providing OverWatch whether that be
11:53:22
through counter snipers or other technology prefer to have sterile rooftops did the Secret Service use any
11:53:29
drones for surveillance that day so again I'm not going to get into specifics of that day in itself but
11:53:36
there are times uh during a security plan that the Secret Service does deploy an asset like a drone were reports that
11:53:43
the shooter used a drone just a few hours before the rally start time is
11:53:48
that accurate I have heard those same reports and again am waiting for the final
11:53:53
report do you know if you can't answer the question that's your answer but can you
11:54:00
answer this do you know do you know I'm not asking yes or no but do you know if
11:54:05
the shooter used a drone before the shooting that information has been
11:54:11
passed to us from the FBI how many Secret Service agents were assigned to president Trump on the day
11:54:17
of the rally again I'm not going to get into the specifics of the numbers of personnel that we had there but we feel
11:54:25
that there was a sufficient number of Agents assigned there are reports that several agents assigned to the rally on
11:54:30
July 13th were were temporary agents agents not normally assigned to president Trump is that
11:54:37
accurate what I can tell you is that the agents that were assigned to former president Trump our Secret Service
11:54:43
